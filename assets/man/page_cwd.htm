<h4>TopoDroid Project Folders</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In order to manage cave survey projects involving several survey sessions, it is advisable to use a specific work directory (folder) for each cave project.<br>
The default survey folder is "TopoDroid".<br>
The folder name "tmp" is reserved. If you type it, the dafault folder is used.<br> 
<!-- The name of any work directory must begin with "TopoDroid" (case independent), otherwise "TopoDroid-" is prepended.<br> -->
The project folders are created inside TopoDroid base folder "Documents/TDX".<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are stored only in the
app private "files" folder (in the <i>primary external storage</i>: for example "/sdcard/Android/data/com.topodroid.TDX/files").
The project folders contain only the survey database of the project and survey folders.<br><p>

The name of the current project folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>Main window</u>.
</div><br><p>

<b>Warning</b><br>
Future Android versions may force the project folder to be under the app private "files" folder.
