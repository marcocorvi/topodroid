<h4>TopoDroid Project Folders</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In order to manage cave survey projects involving several survey sessions, it is advisable to use a specific work directory (folder) for each cave project.<br>
The default survey folder is "TopoDroid".<br>
The folder name "tmp" is reserved. If you type it, the dafault folder is used.<br> 
<!-- The name of any work directory must begin with "TopoDroid" (case independent), otherwise "TopoDroid-" is prepended.<br> -->
The project folders are created inside TopoDroid base folder "Documents/TDX".<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are stored only in the
app private <i>files</i> folder (in the <i>primary external storage</i>: for example "/sdcard/Android/data/com.topodroid.TDX/files").<br>
The drawing symbols files are stored in the <i>point</i>, <i>line</i>, and <i>area</i> folders.<br>
The firmware files are in the <i>bin</i> folder.<br>
The exported calibration files are in the <i>ccsv</i> folder, and the memory dumps in the <i>dump</i> folder.<br><p>

The project folders contain only the survey database of the project and survey folders.<br>
The drawing symbols in use in the project are configured in the project database. When a project is created, only the default drawing symbols
are enabled in the configuration. Other symbols can be enabled from the "Palette" button of the <i>Main Window</i>.<br><p>

The name of the current project folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>Main window</u>.
</div><br><p>

<b>Warning</b><br>
Future Android versions may force the project folder to be under the app private "files" folder.
