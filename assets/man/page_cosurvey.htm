<h4>CO-SURVEYING</h4>

Co-surveying [XE] is a surveying in which two TopoDroid share the data downloaded from the DistoX (or manually entered).  Each new data, as well as changes to data are propagated from one TopoDroid to the other.<br><p>

<b>IMPORTANT: From  v. 4.1.1i co-surveying is not compiled in the production apk.</b><br><p>

<b>WARNING</b>
Co-surveying messaging uses the character '|' (pipe) as field separator. Therefore this character must not be used in any text input.<br><p>

Co-surveying is a very experimental feature. Use in production survey at your own risk. To enable it you must add the key-value pair "cosurvey=on" to the "configs" table of the device10.sqlite database.  Two TopoDroids share the survey data via bluetooth.  In order to execute a co-surveying you must connect your TopoDroid to that on another Android.<br><p>

To enable co-surveying you must select the "tester" level.  One TopoDroid must be set into co-surveying service mode: to do this select the "Co-Surveying" setting.  The other TopoDroid can then connect to it, through the "co-survey" menu in the <u>main window</u>.  This menu displays a dialog with a list of available Androids; select that with the service TopoDroid and press the <i>Connect</i> button. A short message on both devices should appear that informs you that the two TopoDroids are now synchronized for co-surveying.<br><p>

The co-surveying dialog closes when you tap a command.  You need to open it again to close the connection, with the <i>Disconnect</i> button.  In case the two TopoDroids go out of sync and do not manage to share  the data, press the <i>Sync</i> button 
to synchronize them again.<br><p>

When the two TopoDroids are connected, you can start surveying. When you create the new survey it will appear also in the other TopoDroid.<br><p>

The survey data can be downloaded by either app, and they appear in both. Likewise all the survey data editing done in one app are transmitted to the other.<br><p>

This works also for sketch info: when you create a new sketch this is available also in the other app.  You and your friend can open the sketch and edit the drawing(s) independently.  However each TopoDroid keeps its own drawings.  The drawings are not forwarded to the other TopoDroid. Therefore, each of you have your own copy of the sketches. In this way you can make two independent draft that can be combined later at home.<br><p>
