<h4>SKETCH MERGE AND SPLIT</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In the <i>Sketch rename/delete</i> dialog you can either rename or delete the opened sketch.<br><p>

If <i>split/merge</i> [G] is enabled there are also buttons to split the sketch (ie, extract part of the drawings creating a
new sketch), and merge the drawings of another sketch in the current sketch.
<br><p>

<b>Sketch split</b><br>
There is also a button to split the sketch. This creates a new sketch populated with items selected from the current sketch.
To select these items trace a border surrounding them in the <u>sketch window</u>.<br>
You can specify the name of the new sketch. However its origin is the same as that of the current sketch.
Likewise it has the same type of profile view as the current sketch.<br>
If the <u>sketch window</u> is displaying the plan view, the new sketch plan view is populated with the selected items, and the profile view
is empty. The converse, if the <u>sketch window</u> is displaying the profile view.<br>
Only visible items are selected for the split.<br>
<p>

You can choose whether to move the selected items to the new sketch of to copy them to it.<br><p>

After this operation the <u>sketch window</u> displays the new sketch.<br><p>

<b>Sketch merge</b><br>
If the outline of another sketch is being displayed you can merge it within the current sketch.<br>
The items of the outlined sketch are copied in the current sketch.<br><p>
