<h4>Device TROUBLESHOOTING</h4>

<!--
<b>DistoX scan</b><br>
TopoDroid may fail to find a DistoX on the first scan, and you might have to try two or three times before the DistoX is found.<br><p>

If the DistoX scan fails repeatedly, you may try a scan with the <i>Settings</i> app. If this app fails to find the DistoX, there is some problem with the bluetooth on your Android or on the DistoX,
and you will not be able to use TopoDroid with the DistoX.<br><p>
-->

<b>Device pairing</b><br>

Before TopoDroid can connect to a device, this must be paired with the Android.<br>
You can pair Android with the active DistoX through the <i>pair</i> menu or you can use the <i>Settings</i> app to pair the DistoX.<br><p>

If Android asks the DistoX PIN enter 0000 (four zeros).<br>
For the Sap5 PIN enter 000000 (six zeros).<br>
Android should not ask the Bric4 PIN, nor the DistoXBLE PIN.<br><p>

Once paired with the DistoX, the Android should keep the pairing, and not request the PIN again. If it keeps requesting the PIN every time you download data from the DistoX,
try using the <i>insecure</i>  socket setting.<br><p>

<!-- If you have problem connecting and downloading the data with a DistoX device try enabling the <i>Z6 workaround</i> setting.<br><p> -->

<b>DistoXBLE connecting but not downloading</b><br>

This can happen immediately after having enabled the Android Bluetooth.
The workaround is to switch the DistoXBLE off and on.
TopoDroid should pick again the connection automatically and start downloading the data.
<br><p>

<b>DistoXBLE not found in Bluetooth (Samsung)</b><br>
There is an option in the "developer options" to <i>show unsupported LE devices</i>.
After turning it on, the DistoXBLE appears among the Bluetooth devices.
<br><p>

<b>DistoXBLE or BRIC5 not connecting (One UI)</b><br>
Enable "developer options" (go to <i>Settings</i> &gt; <i>About phone</i> &gt; <i>Software information</i>
and tap <i>Build number</i> seven times).
Then go to <i>Settings</i> &gt; <i>Developer options</i> and scroll down to <i>Bluetooth settings</i>,
enable <i>Show Bluetooth devices without names</i>.
Try toggling <i>Allow BLE audio</i> if it is enabled - some devices do not support BLE audio.
