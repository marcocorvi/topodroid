<h4>PocketTopo COLOR MAP</h4>

This dialog is opened selecting the <i>PocketTopo</i> color-map setting (in the Import/Export section).<br><p>


It displays a table with three columns.
<ul>
<li>PocketTopo color</li>
<li>associated TopoDroid line (Therion name)</li>
<li>associated TopoDroid point symbol (Therion name)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The symbol names used in the color-map are the "Therion names", ie, the filenames of the symbol files.<br>
A few symbols are hardcoded in the program: <i>user</i>, <i>wall</i> (line), <i>water</i> (area), and <i>section</i> (point and line).<br>
Also <i>label</i> is hardcoded. It cannot be used in the color-map because is rendered with a text.<br><p>

The color-map is used in the import of ".top" files, to map PocketTopo colors to TopoDroid drawing items.
