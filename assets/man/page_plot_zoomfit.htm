<h4>SKETCH ZOOM-FIT</h4>

This dialog is opened by the menu "Zoom fit".<br><p>

With this dialog you can
<ul>
<li>Choose the orientation of the presentation, and fit the drawing into the display</li>
<li>Set a graph-paper grid or a metric grid</li>
<li>Center the drawing at a given station</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b>Orientation</b><br>
This orientation refers to the presentation of the drawing by TopoDroid and is not related to
the <i>Portrait/Landscape</i> orientation managed by Android.<br><p>

The orientation applies only to the plan/profile views.
You can choose to display the drawing with the North/Upward direction to the top of the screen or to the left.<br><p>

<b>Graph-paper grid</b><br>
Instead of the metric grid, with cells corresponding to the selected grid units,
it is possible to have a graph-paper grid with cells of 1 mm size.<br>
In this case the sketch scale must be chosen among 1:100, 1:200, 1:300, 1:400, and 1:500.<br><p>

Close the dialog with the <i>Cancel</i> button to cancel any action.<br><p>
