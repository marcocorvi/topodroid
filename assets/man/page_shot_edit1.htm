<h4>SHOT EDIT</h4>

This dialog is opened by tapping on a shot data entry in the <u>Survey Data window</u>.<br><p>

It displays
<ul>
<li><b>length, azimuth, inclination</b>. Editable for manually entered shots; not editable
 for downloaded shots. DistoX backshots are marked with '*'</li>
<li>differences of acceleration, magnetic field, and magnetic dip from the respective average values. Only for DistoX2 shots</li>
<li>date and time of the shot</li>
<li><b>stations</b> and
<ul>
<li><b>left arrow</b>: load previous leg</li>
<li><b>reverse</b> button: swap stations</li>
<li><b>right arrow</b>: load next leg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shot <b>comment</b></li>
<li>profile <b>extend</b>: "left", "vertical", "right". The "extend" is "unset" if none is checked</li>
<li>If the shot has a <b>mark</b>, this is displayed on the right of the extend: (x) feature, (&#8741;) ridge, (v) backsight, (o) generic.</li>
</ul><br><p>

Properties buttons:

</ul>

Action buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Cancel</b>: close the dialog without saving</li>
<li><b>More/Less</b>: show/hide additional actions [A]</li>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the changes without closing the dialog</li>
<li><b>OK</b>: save the changes and close the dialog</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b>Station names</b><br>
Station names cannot contain special characters ('/'. '\'. '?', '&lt;', '&gt;', '|', ':', '"'),
and must end with an alphanumeric charactere or
one of '-' '.' '_' '@'.
<br><p>

For <i>BRIC</i> shots the date and time are the values downloaded with the shot data from the device.
For other devices and for manually entered shots, they are the time of download/insertion.<br><p>

The shot flags, "duplicate", "surface" and "commented", are mutually exclusive.
The survey data info takes into account these flags.
The export of the shot is also affected by the shot flag, either with an export flag, if the format supports it, or as comment.<br><p>

There is a warning if, upon editing a leg shot, it differs from another leg between the same stations more than one fourth in length, or 15&deg;.<br><p>

<b>Station cut-n-paste</b><br>
Station names can be 'cut', 'copied', and 'pasted' across the app, in any dialog where there is a station entry
field.<br><p>

Long-tapping the station entry field opens the drop-down menu with the three options
<ul>
<li>cut</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>paste</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Station reassignment</b><br>
Station reassignment can be initiated only from a leg.
By default the reassignment affects all the shots following the leg up to the end.
If the custom setting <i>splay station</i> is disabled, the stations of splay shots are not reassigned.
<br><p>

Normal reassignment should be used only for very last few legs, in case a leg
has not been detected (eg. only two data), or erroneously detected (very close splays
taken as a leg).<br><p>

More control on the shots that are reassigned is achieved with the "multi-shot" selection,
where the user can pick the shots to reassign individually.
<br><p>
</div>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Splay group</b><br>
A group of splays consists of all the splays between two legs.
Splay group station change applies only to the contiguous set of splays with same station as the edit shot.
Only FROM station must have been specified.
<br><p>

If the custom setting "Splay group" is set, only the splays after the editing shot are modified.
<br><p>
</div>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Splay classes</b><br>
Splay classes are enabled with a "custom setting". There are four classes:
<ul>
<li><i>normal</i>, generic, splays. Blue</li>
<li><i>x-section</i> splays. Green</li>
<li><i>horizontal</i>, plan-view, splays. Dark blue</li>
<li><i>vertical</i>, profile-view, splays. Violet</li>
</ul>

The <i>Splay class</i> button cycles through these four classes.
The splay shot is set to the chosen class, when the data are saved.
If the "all splay" button is checked, the class is set also to all previous contiguous
"normal" splays.<br><p>

Splay classes can also be set with the "multi-shot" selection.
In multi-shot you can select splays that are not contiguous and assign them all a splay class.<br><p>

If you take splays shots in a consistent way, splay classes can be set editing the leg shot and checking the
splay group button.
You must take first the x-section splays starting with +90 and going around in circle.
Next you take the H-splays. Finally, you take the splays in the vertical plane starting again with +90.<br><p>
</div>


<b>Additional actions</b><br>

At the usage profiles "Basic" or "Normal" the additional actions are only a button to <i>delete</i> the shot.<br><p>

At higher usage profiles it has more buttons:<p>

<ul>
<li><img src="btn_photo.png" width="36" border="1" > <a href="page_photo_dialog.htm">photo</a></li>
<li><img src="btn_audio.png" width="36" border="1" > <a href="page_audio.htm">audio</a> comment</li>
<li><img src="btn_sensor.png" width="36" border="1" > <a href="page_sensors.htm">Sensor measurements</a></li>
<!-- li><img src="btn_shot.png" width="36" border="1" > add a shot before this (manually entering the data)</li -->
<li><img src="btn_split.png" width="36" border="1" > <a href="page_survey_split_move.htm">split the survey</a> at this shot (creating a new survey or append to another survey)</li>
<li><b>Color</b>, only for splays</li>
<li><img src="btn_calib_check.png" width="36" border="1" > mark the shot as calibration-check (only for legs)</li>
<li><img src="btn_recompute.png" width="36" border="1" > recompute the direction of the survey shots, starting from this shot (only for Cavway) [T]</li>
<li><img src="btn_delete.png" width="36" border="1" > delete the shot</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

For legs there are also fields to add intermediate LRUD.<br><p>

The <b>delete</b> button does not remove the shot from the database.
The shot gets marked as "deleted" and can be later recovered with the
<a href="./page_undelete.htm">Recovery</a> dialog.
If the shot is the first shot of a leg you can also delete all the shots of the leg, by
checking the checkbox besides the buttons.
<br><p>

Leg shots have also a <b>calibration</b> button. This button marks the shot as "calibration-check".
These shots are not used in the survey, and their data should be taken at different roll angles.
They are recorded in the database, and are a record of the reliability of the device calibration
when the survey was done. They can be displayed with the
<a href="./page_undelete.htm">Recovery</a> dialog.
<br><p>

<b>Survey split</b><br>
This button opens a dialog for the new survey info.
Next the survey data are assigned to the new survey, beginning with this shot.
Afterwards the program continues with the new survey.
You may need to split surveys when you have data from two (separate) survey pieces stored in the device:
these are downloaded to a single survey which must be then split accordingly.<br>

At tester level you get also the option to <b>move</b> the data to another survey.
Select the target survey from the pull-down option set, and tap the "Move" button.
<br><p>

<b>Warning</b>. It is advisable to make a zip archive before splitting/moving the
survey and back it up to a safe place.<br><p>

<!--
<b>At-station LRUD</b><br>
LRUD shots, at either the FROM or the TO station, are added by filling the four LRUD edit boxes
and tapping the <i>Add LRUD</i> button. <br>
It is also possible to add "intermediate" LRUD entering the distance (in the current units) along the shot,
between the LRUD point and the FROM station.<br>
For splay shots there is only the FROM station.<br>
"Intermediate" LRUD are appended to the data list, the others are added before the shot.<br>
The manual LRUD are marked as "x-splays".<br>
<br><p>
-->

<b>Splay color</b><br>
For splays there is also a button to assign a color to the shot.<br>
The shot list is not immediately updated with colors.
To display the splay with color press the "Refresh" button.<br><p>
