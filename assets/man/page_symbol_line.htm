<h4>LINE_TOOLS</h4>

The "line" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Three line tools: "user", "section", and "wall", are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid private folder <i>line</i>.
This directory is populated with the line tools packaged in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

<b>Name</b><br>
Refer to the <a href="page_symbol_point.htm">Point Tool</a> for how to specify the names.
<br><p> 

<b>Group</b><br>
This attribute is used to replace a missing symbol with the group symbol.<br><p>

<b>Dash</b><br>
The "dash" directive specifies that the line is drawn with a dashed scheme.
For example, "dash 15 5" means that the line is drawn with segments of 15 units, separated by 5 units spaces.
<br><p>

<b>Style</b><br> 
The "style" directive is used to draw lines using sparse points.<br>
A "style x3" means that the line is drawn using one every three points. The effect is that the line is less "curvy".<br>
If you want straight segments use "style straight".
<br><p>

<b>Effect path</b><br>
This option is used to define lines with complex style.<br><p>

<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>
The "level" attribute has value the flag for the views enabled on this line items.<br>
