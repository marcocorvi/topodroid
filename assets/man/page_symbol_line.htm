<h4>LINE_TOOLS</h4>

The "line" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Two line tools, "user" and "wall", are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid subdirectory <i>symbol/line</i>.
This directory is populated with the line tools packaged in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

The line tool file contains lines specifying the property of the drawing tool.
