<h4>LINE_TOOLS</h4>

The "line" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Two line tools, "user", "section", and "wall", are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid private folder <i>line</i>.
This directory is populated with the line tools packaged in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

The line tool file contains lines specifying the property of the drawing tool.

<lI>"group GROUP", specifies the group this line belongs to [optional, default no group]</li>
<li>"color rgb alpha" (rgb and alpha in hex format, for example '0x00ff00' is green, and '0xff' is fully opaque) [rgb mandatory, alpha is optional,

<b>Name</b><br>
Refer to the <a href="page_symbol_point.htm">Point Tool</a> for how to specify the names.
<br><p> 

<b>Group</b><br>
Line tools in the same group can be joined together by "continuation".<br><p>

The "group" attribute is used to specify that the various "wall" line types can be joined together.<br><p>

<b>Dash</b><br>
The "dash" directive specifies that the line is drawn with a dashed scheme.
For example, "dash 15 5" means that the line is drawn with segments of 15 units, separated by 5 units spaces.
<br><p>

<b>Style</b><br> 
The "style" directive is used to draw lines using sparse points.<br>
A "style x3" means that the line is drawn using one every three points. The effect is that the line is less "curvy".<br>
If you want straight segments us "style straight".
<br><p>

<b>Effect path</b><br>
This option is used to define lines with complex style.<br><p>

<b>Level</b><br>
The "level" attribute takes value the flag for the views enabled on this line items.<br>
The flag is a number sum of 1 (base), 2 (floor), 4 (fills), 8 (ceiling), and 16 (artifacts).
