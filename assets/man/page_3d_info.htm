<h4>3D model info</h4>

The 3D info dialog is opened by the menu "Info" in the 3D viewer window.<br><p>

It presents some global information
<ul>
<li>Size of the grid cells</li>
<li>Current direction of view</li>
<li>Number of surveys</li>
<li>Number of legs and number of splays</li>
<li>Number of stations</li>
<li>Total length</li>
<li>Total depth</li>
<li>Estimated volume (if the wall model has been computed)</li>
<li>Longitude extent</li>
<li>Latitude extent</li>
<li>Altitude range</li>
</ul><br>

This is followed by the list of surveys that compose the model.
Tapping a survey pops up a dialog with the number of legs and splays of the
survey and their lengths.
