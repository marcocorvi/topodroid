<h4>3D rose diagram</h4>

This dialog displays the 3D view of the directions of the
survey legs.<br>
The reference is made of a green line pointing East, a blue
line pointing North, and a red line pinting upwards.
<br><p>

The direction of view is displayed on the top of the screen.<br>
The inclination is restricted to negative values (ie, -90 means looking down
and 0 means looking from a side).<br><p>

The dialog is opened from the menu "3D rose diagram" of the 3D viewer window.
