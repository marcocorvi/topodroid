<h4>Shot accuracy</h4>

Together with each shot, the DistoX records and transmit to TopoDroid also the values of the intensity of the magnetic field (arbitrary units), that of the gravitional field (arbitrary units), and the dip angle, that is the angle the mangetic field makes with the horizontal plane.<br><p>

By comparing these values with their average values TopoDroid can detect whether a shot might be affected by some anomaly, and should therefore be redone. These unreliable shots are displayed with a red background.<br><p>

The amount these values can differ from their averages before the shot is declared unreliable are specified by the accuracy settings.<br><p>

<h4>Accuracy settings</h4>

<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<li><i>Acceleration</i>: acceleration value above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
<li><i>Magnetic</i>: magnetic field value above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
<li><i>Dip angle</i>: magnetic dip value above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2) [units degrees]</li>
</ul>
