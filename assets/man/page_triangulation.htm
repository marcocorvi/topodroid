    <h1>Triangulated</h1>

    <p>
      Triangulated is a type of survey where the measured azimuths are discarded and substituted by trigonometrically calculated ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is intended to be used in non-uniform magnetic environments like iron ore caves (or your house).
      Both the lengths and the inclinations measured by your equipment are used and kept.
      The measured azimuths are substituted by the ones calculated by the software.
      This means that <b>after calculation, your original azimuths are lost</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Triangulation is enabled by clicking on the <i>Trigonometrically calculated azimuths</i> survey creation option checkbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a creation time option.
      It can only be enabled when creating a new survey.
      It cannot be disabled once the survey is created.
    </p>

    <p>
      The survey should be made of a net (or a ladder) of triangles.
      Therefore you:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>measure 0-1, 1-2, and 0-2;</li>
      <li>check (and correct if necessary) the mirroring status of station 2;</li>
      <li>make any drawings based on stations 0, 1 and 2;</li>
      <li>measure two of the followings legs: 0-3, 1-3 and 2-3 (which can be measured as backshots if preferred, i.e. 3-0, 3-1 and 3-2);</li>
      <li>check mirroring status of station 3;</li>
      <li>make any drawings based on station 3;</li>
      <li>and so on.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each new station should be connected to 2 previous ones.
      The actual calculation of the azimuths is done when entering the drawing window.
    </p>

    <h2>Stations</h2>

    <p>
      In triangulated surveys, on the <i>Edit shot</i> dialog box available in the <i>Drawing</i> window in <i>Edit</i> mode, you can see the triangulation status of each station.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are 4 possible status for stations in a triangulated survey:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <i>Unprocessed</i>: for stations included in the survey before (re)entering the drawing window.
        You will never actually see a station in this status, as the calculation of the azimuths is done when entering the drawing window where you can see the station status.
      </li>
      <li><i>Reference</i>: only the 2 stations of the first leg of the first triangle keeps it's original azimuth as it will be used as reference for all other triangulated legs.</li>
      <li>
        <i>Adjusted</i>: for all other stations that form triangles, i.e., that have already been calculated.
        The azimuth of their legs is calculated by trigonometry using the lengths and inclinations measured by the device.
        The original measured azimuths are discarded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Unadjusted</i>: for stations on legs that don't form a triangle.
        You should not see any unadjusted stations.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Mirroring stations</h2>

    <p>
      When using the Law of Cosines to calculate the azimuths of the 2 new legs of a triangle, there are 2 possible solutions that will be called here clockwise and counter-clockwise.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="triangulation_clockwise.png" alt="Mirroring stations: clockwise triangle (unmirrored)" />
      <figcaption><i>Figure 1: Mirroring stations - clockwise triangle (unmirrored)</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="triangulation_counter-clockwise.png" alt="Mirroring stations: counter-clockwise triangle (mirrored)" />
      <figcaption><i>Figure 2: Mirroring stations - counter-clockwise triangle (mirrored)</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      On the above example the first, clockwise triangle, is the option automatically chosen by the software.
      If the correct version is the second one, you can change it by selecting station 2, opening the <i>Edit shot</i> dialog box and clicking on the <i>Mirror</i> button.
      You will get the second, counter-clockwise triangle.
      To get back to the original version, just reopen the <i>Edit shot</i> dialog box and click on the <i>Unmirror</i> button.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is impossible for the software to guess the correct version of the triangle from the arbitrary azimuths obtained from the measuring device.
      The user must choose the correct version.
      It is recommended that the user checks, and corrects if necessary, the mirroring status of each new triangle BEFORE starting to draw any part of a sketch using the new station as reference.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      The triangulation algorithm carries out trigonometric calculations to determine the azimuths of both legs used to define a new station therefore properly positioning it.
      It is based on the Law of Cosines.
    </p>

    <p>
      It uses the 2 previously existing stations as references to calculate the azimuths of the legs connected to the new station.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or, for the very first triangle, it uses the measured azimuth of the first measured leg.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be suitable for large surveys but it has only been tested on small test cases.
    </p>

    <h2>General notes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Don't create shots between 2 previously existing stations.</li>
      <li>
        Don't use vertical (or quasi-vertical) legs as reference legs for a new triangle as the azimuth of a vertical leg is undefined and the azimuth of the reference leg is essential for calculating the azimuths of the 2 new legs of each triangle.
        In practical terms, don't use as reference stations for a new station 2 stations that are vertically aligned.
      </li>
      <li>Always check (and correct if necessary) the mirroring status of each new station BEFORE using it as an actual reference in your sketch.</li>
      <li>
        You should not create splays in triangulated surveys as you compass isn't realiable (that's the reason you are using a triangulated ssurvey in the first time, right?).
        All measurements that would normally be done with a splay should, in a triangulated survey, be done with a new station (which should be connected to 2 previous stations).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you follow these instruction properly, you won't see any unadjusted azimuths.
