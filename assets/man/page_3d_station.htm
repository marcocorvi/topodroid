<h4>3D VIEWER - Stations</h4>

The display of stations and the actions on them are controlled by the third button ("triangle with a central dot").<br>
If the button has a red dot on the top-right the stations are selectable.<br>
The button switches between the two states with a long press.<br><p>

The stations can have three display modes
<ul>
<li><i>invisible</i>, ie, hidden</li>
<li>visible as <i>points</i></li>
<li>visible as <i>names</i></li>
</ul><p>

When visible and the state is "selectable" the stations are selected with a touch on the dot or the name.
The selected station is highlighted with a red dot or a boxed name.
It data (name and coordinates) are shown in a botton green bar.
This bar contains three buttons,
<ul>
<li><i>ruler</i> toggles the measure mode. In this mode the program measures the distance between the selected station
and any another station, chosen with a touch on the screeen. It computes the 3D distance and the displacements 
in the North, East and vertical directions.
If the two stations are path connected it computes also the shortest path length, and highlights the path in green on the 3D.</li>
<li><i>center</i> makes the selected station as the center of the rotations of the model</li>
<li><i>close</i> deselects the station. The station can be also deselected with a touch on it on the screen.</li>
</ul>
