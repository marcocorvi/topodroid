<h4>SKETCH FLIP AND SHIFT</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Profile sketch flip</b> [E]<br>
When viewing the profile, a long tap on the <i>Plan/Profile</i> button opens a confirmation dialog to flip the profile sketch horizontally.
<br>
The dialog has a checkbox to reverse the "extend" value of the shots as well.
This is enabled by default.
Only the shots that are displayed in the profile, are reversed, ie, their "extend" is changed.
Therefore shot hidden behind a station are not affected.
By this means you can reverse only a portion of the survey data.
<br>
Shots "extend" can also be reversed with a multi-selection in the survey <u>data window</u>.
<br><p>

<b>Sketch transform</b> [E]<br>

Shifting, scaling and arbitrary affine transformations are enabled by custom settings [G].<br><p>

The drawing can be shifted as a whole by selecting the <i>Fix ref</i> checkbox in the sketch reference dialog.
Then in <i>move/zoom</i> mode the drawing can be shifted by dragging it with two fingers.<br><p>

Scaling and affine transformation are accomplished by touching the screen with three fingers. The motion of the fingers
defines the parameters of the affine transformation. In this way the sketch can be arbitrarily scaled, rotated
and skewed.<br>
If the general affine transform is not enabled, the sketch is only scaled.<br><p>


<b>WARNING</b><br>
Sketch transformation is CPU intensive, especially for large sketches,
because it changes the coordinates of every drawing point, 
and the app may appear unresponsive if the sketch is big.<br><p>
