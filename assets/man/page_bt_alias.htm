<h4>Bluetooth Alias</h4>

With this window the user can set an alias for a known bluetooth device.<br><p>

The device model must be selected among the given options.<br>
It is important to select the correct device, because this determines how TopoDroid
exchanges data with the device.<br><p>

Unless the model is an old DistoX (first version based on Disto A3) the device code must be entered.
This can be a four-digit number, or contain characters.
TopoDroid does not check the code, but it is advisable to use the code reported by
the device.<br><p>

The alias for the device must be entered as reported in the Android listing of the paired
bluetooth devices.<br><p>

The button "Add" adds a new alias or change an existing alias.<br>
The button "Close" closes the window.<br><p>

The window contains also a listing of the bluetooth aliases.<br><p>

To remove an alias tap the entry in the list and confirm to remove.<br><p>
