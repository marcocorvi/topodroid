<h4>SKETCH AREA</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point of the border of an area (in edit mode of the <u>Drawing window</u>),
and tap the <i>Edit</i> button.<br><p>

You can change the type of area, by selecting it from the scroll down list.<br><p>

Area properties:
<ul>
<li><b>visibility</b> of the area border</li>
<li><b>layers</b>, canvas views the area belongs to</li> 
</ul>
<br><p>

The area border visibility is written in the Therion export, so that it can be used when the survey map is generated.<br>
TopoDroid displays the area shaded region without a border if the visibility is off. Otherwise a light grey border is shown.<br>
The default value of the area border visibility is a setting.<br><p>

<b>Point decimation</b><br>
The number of border points can be reduced by either 
keeping one point every two (single check) or one every four (double check).<br>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>
Finally you can change the canvas views to area belongs to.
The views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code.
<br><p>
The area is not displayed if all its views are OFF.
In this case the border points will nevertheless be shown in edit mode, so that the area edit dialog remains accessible, and
the area can be re-assigned to a canvas view.
</div><br><p>

The <i>BACK</i> key closes the dialog.
