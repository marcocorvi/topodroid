<h4>SKETCH AREA</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point of the border of an area (in edit mode of the <u>sketch window</u>),
and tap the <i>Edit</i> button.<br><p>

You can change the type of area, by selecting it from the scroll down list.<br><p>

Area properties:
<ul>
<li><b>visibility</b> of the area border</li>
<li><b>layers</b>, canvas views the area belongs to</li> 
</ul>
<br><p>

The area border visibility is written in the Therion export, so that it can be used when the survey map is generated.<br>
TopoDroid displays the area shaded region without a border if the visibility is off. Otherwise a light grey border is shown.<br>
The default value of the area border visibility is a setting.<br><p>

<b>Point decimation</b><br>
The number of border points can be reduced by either 
keeping one point every two (single check) or one every four (double check).<br>

<b>Layers</b><br>
Finally you can change the canvas views to area belongs to.
The views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code.
The area is not displayed if all its views are OFF.
The border points will nevertheless be shown in edit mode, so that the area edit dialog remains accessible.

The <i>BACK</i> key closes the dialog.
