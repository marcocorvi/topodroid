<h4>SURVEY NOTES</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Notes</i> button of the survey <u>data window</u>, 
the survey <u>info window</u>, and the <u>sketch window</u> (in "moving" mode).
<br><p>

With this dialog you can write and edit a generic text with notes that integrates the data and the drawing
of your survey.<br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the changes and close the dialog</li>
<li><u>Back</u> key: close the dialog without saving the changes</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The notes are saved in a text file in the "txt" subdirectory of the current work directory,
which by default is "TopoDroid".<br>
You can also edit this file with other text editors.
