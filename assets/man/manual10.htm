<h3>[10] SKETCH DRAWING</h3>

The canvas shows the midline with the splay shots.  It can be moved around dragging it with one (or two) finger(s), zoom in/out with two fingers.
The plan-view North and the profile-view vertical are upward.
It is not possible to rotate the canvas.<br><p>

Tap the <u>Draw</u> button: the app goes in <b>draw</b> mode and the button is highlighted with a white border. Now you can draw with your finger (two fingers still pan and zoom). With the <u>undo</u> and <u>redo</u> button you cancel the last drawn or deleted objects and put them back again.<br><p>

While in draw mode, the sketch can also be moved by dragging it from the side of the canvas and zoomed with zoom controls if these function have been enabled through the settings. This lets you work with a stylus without the need for two-finger actions.<br><p>

With the <a href="page_tools.hm">tool picker</a> button you change the drawing tool: line, "area" (a shaded region), or iconic symbol.<br><p>

<b>Point tools</b><br>
Point tools are iconic symbols. To add a symbol to the sketch tap the canvas where you want to place it.
With "labels" you must also enter the text in the coming dialog.<br><p>

<b>Line tools</b><br>
Line tools are line-drawing styles. 
Lines have an orientation (when a line is selected, in edit mode, its orientation is shown by a yellow tick pointing to the left).<br><p>

The line thickness is one of the <u>Settings</u>. There are separate options for the centerline/splays and the drawing line thickness.<br><p>

<b>Section lines</b><br>
The "section" line is special as it is always made into a straight segment with a short tick showing the direction of view.
A "section" point is automatically added near the end of the section line. This point has the "scrap" option preset to the line scrap and is deleted when you delete the section line.<br><p>

"Section" lines cannot be erased with the <u>eraser</u> tool.
To remove a "section" line, select it with the <u>edit</u> tool and delete it with the "delete" button.<br><p>

Its points cannot be moved in the canvas, like for points of other lines, neither they can be removed.<br><p>

The pointwise actions do not apply to the endpoints of "section" lines.<br><p>

<b>Area tools</b><br>
Area tools are region shaders. To draw an area trace its contour. You do not need to be very precise as TopoDroid will close it.<br>
The water area is special because it is "closed horizontally" in the profile sketch and in the x-sections, because the surface of a pond is usually horizontal. To draw a water area (in the profile sketch) trace only the lower bottom line of the pond.<br><p>

<b>Undo, redo, erase and edit</b><br><p>

Drawing mistakes can be corrected. The <u>Undo</u> button removes the last item. To erase a line or a symbol drawn long ago, without loosing all the intermediate work, there are two choices: the <u>Erase</u> mode and the <u>Edit</u> mode.<br><p>

The <u>Eraser</u> is very intuitive: it cancels everything you pass your finger over, except stations, shots, and section lines. Just like a real eraser on the paper: if you pass it in the middle of a line it erases only the central portion (thus leaving two lines). However the erasing can be filtered to erase only items of one class: points, lines, or areas.<br>
<p>

The <u>Edit</u> [A] button is not so intuitive, but it is very powerful, as it allows pointwise editing operations. In this mode all the drawn items are shown as little green dots. To select the item to edit tap on one of its green dots (icons have only one dot). If there are several dots close together, they will all be selected (and shown with a pink circle), but only one will be chosen for editing (big green circle). If it is not what you wanted, cycle through the selected points with the <u>Prev</u>-<u>Next</u> buttons.<br>

Except for the endpoints of "section" lines, the points of the the drawn items can be moved on the canvas by dragging them.<br>

The edit tool can be filtered to select only dots of one class: points, lines, areas, shots, or stations.<br><p>

The size of the green dots and the selection radius are two <u>Settings</u>.<br><p>

Segments of Bezier lines have two control points. These are stored with the segment end-point and when this is the selected editing point the two control points are shown as pink circles. Each of them can be moved around by dragging it with the finger.<br><p>

To clear the selection tap somewhere else in the canvas. The item can be deleted (removed) or its <a href="page_item_edit.htm">properties</a> changed ("tool" button). Editing applies also to shots and stations.
<br><p>

Once selected an orientable point icons can be rotated also with side-drag, if this is enabled.<br><p>

A survey shot (leg or splay) has a green dot in the middle to select it. If selected a horizontal yellow segment appear and the shot extend can be set by dragging the green dot towards the left or right end, or to the middle.<br><p>

<h4>Point-wise edit actions [A]</h4>

The second to the right button applies only to drawing items and has a drop-down menu of advanced editing actions, for either points [P],
or lines (except "section" lines) [L], or areas [A].
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><i>Snap to nearby point</i> [P,L,A]: move the point to coincide with the closest nearby point (no action if there is no nearby point)</li>
<li><i>Snap to nearby splays/line</i> [L,A]. Lines are deformed to pass through the splay endpoints that are close enough. For areas the point is moved to coincide with the closest line point, and the pieces of the area border before and after it are replaced with pieces of border that follow the line path</li>
<li><i>duplicate</i> the point [L,A]. The new point is inserted "after" the selected point. It is added to the selection set, and you can select it with the Prev-Next buttons</li>
<li><i>Cut</i> [L] the line at the point, thus making two lines</li>
<li><i>Straighten</i> [L,A] the line segment removing the control points</li>
<li><i>Smoothen</i> [L,A] the line segment inserting control points at 1/3 and 2/3 the segment length. Further editing can move them and give any wanted curvature to the segment</li>
<li><i>Remove</i> [L,A] the line/area point. The selected line/area point can be removed also with a long-tap on the "delete" button.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>Range selection modes</h4>
Lines and areas points can be selected individually (point selection mode) or as a range.
To select a range on a line, the last button in the "edit" button-bar must be on.
You select first one endpoint of the range, then the other endpoint.
<br><p>

The range is highlighted orange. Its midpoint gets the big green dot, and it controls how the line range is deformed:
the points on the range are shifted by an amount that depends on the distance from the midpoint. 
The range can have hard or soft bounds. With hard bounds the range is moved as a whole. With soft bounds the points at the ends of the range are moved by an amount proportional to their distance from the end.
