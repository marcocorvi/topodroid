<h3>[13] IMPORT EXPORT </h3>
When you are done, export the survey data and the sketches in your favourite format and transfer the
exported files to your PC, to finish up drafting the cave maps.<br><p>

For safety make a TopoDdroid zip archive and trannsfer it to your PC.
The zip archive is a complete backup of your survey, and it
contains the command to restore the survey data and other information in the database.
You can use it to transfer the survey to a TopoDroid on another Android.<br><p>

Survey data, and zip archive, are exported from the survey <u>info window</u>.<br>
Survey sketches are exported from the <u>sketch window</u> (single sketch) and from the <u>overview window</u> (all sketches in one file).<br><p>

TopoDroid zip archives are stored in the <i>zip</i> folder.<br><p>

Exported data and sketches files are stored in suitably named folders under the "survey" folder.<br><p>

<!-- 
File for survey import are searched in the <i>import</i> folder.<br>
Zip archives for import are searched in the <i>zip</i> folder.<br><p>

<b>Default export formats</b><br>
TopoDroid has two settings to set a default export format for the survey data and one for the sketches.
By default these are both set to "none", ie, no export.
<br><p>

When the default survey data export format is set, TopoDroid exports the survey data in that format before creating a zip archive, so that the export is included in the archive.<br><p>

When the default sketch export format is set, the sketches are exported in this format whenever they are closed from the <u>sketch window</u>.<br>
For cSurvey x-sections are saved as PNG images.<br><p>
-->

<h4>SURVEY IMPORT</h4>
TopoDroid imports survey data from TopoDroid zip archives or from external files.<br>
To import zip archives from the internal folder tap on the "Import" button of the <i>Main Window</i>.<br>
To import external files (or external zip archives) long-tap on the "Import" button.
External files are selected through a system content-provider.<br><p>

The following import formats are supported:
<ul>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Survex</li>
<li>Therion. Only data</li>
<li>VisualTopo</li>
<li>CaveSniper</li>
<li>PocketTopo, including sketches</li>
<li>TopoDroid zip archives</li>
</ul>

A file import fails if a survey with the same name is already in TopoDroid.<br><p>

Zip import fails if the zip has a database version that is too old or is newer than the one in TopoDroid.<br><p>

On import from file formats that have LRUD values, these are converted to x-splays (shown in green).<br><p>

<b>Therion import</b><br>
Only Therion survey files with data in "normal" datamode are importable.<br>
The "declination" command is taken into account: the read azimuth are corrected with the value
of the declination.<br>
TopoDroid does not import Therion scraps.<br><p>

<b>PocketTopo import</b><br>
TopoDroid imports both the survey data and the sketches.
This import maps PocketTopo colors to TopoDroid drawing tools (points and lines).
The mapping can be modified through a setting.<br><p>

<b>Compass import</b><br>
TopoDroid converts imported compass survey from <i>normal</i> datamode to <i>diving</i> datamode [T], if the reletive setting is enabled [G].<br><p>

<b>N.B.</b>
Import may fail (and crash the app) due to failure on the database that TopoDroid cannot intercept.
If this happens delete the partially imported survey and retry to import it.<br><p>

<h4>SURVEY DATA EXPORT</h4>
TopoDroid exports survey data to the following cave-program formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="#compass">Compass</a></li>
<li><a href="#csurvey">cSurvey</a></li>
<li><a href="#survex">Survex</a></li>
<li><a href="#therion">Therion</a></li>
<li><a href="#trobot">TopoRobot</a></li>
<li><a href="#vtopo">VisualTopo</a></li>
<li><a href="#walls">Walls</a></li>
<li><a href="#winkarst">WinKarst</a></li>
<li><a href="#ghtopo">GHTopo</a></li>
<li><a href="#grottolf">Grottolf</a></li>
<li><a href="#ptopo">PocketTopo</a></li>
<li><a href="#polygon">Polygon</a></li>
<li><a href="#topo">Topo</a></li>
</ul>

Furthermore it exports survey data as
<ul>
<li><a href="#csv">CSV</a></li>
<li><a href="#dxf">DXF</a></li>
<li><a href="#kml">KML</a></li>
<li><a href="#geojson">GeoJSON</a></li>
<li><a href="#plt">trackfile</a></li>
<li><a href="#shp">shapefile</a></li>
</ul>
If the survey is not georeferenced the survey data cannot be exported in the last four export formats.
<br><p>

Georeference points are exported with coordinates latitude-longitude [decimal degrees] and altitude above
mean sea level [m].<br>
H/V-splays are treated as normal splays in the exports.<br><p>


<b id="compass">Compass</b> (.dat)<br>
<i>Compass</i> data file are supported both in import and in export.<br>
Import compass files must have extension either ".dat" or ".DAT".<br>
Supported data format are "normal" and "diving".<br>
Data units are 'feet' and 'degrees' (converted to meters and degrees inside TopoDroid).<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>Station prefix</u></li>
<li><u>splays</u></li>
<li><u>L/R swap</u></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b id="csurvey">cSurvey</b> (.csx)<br>
The cSurvey export files require cSurvey v. 1.20 or later.<br>
The <i>cSurvey</i> export from the survey <u>info window</u> includes only the 
survey data, and does not have any sketch.<br>
The make a <i>cSurvey</i> export with a sketch (both plan and profile),
you should export from the <u>drawing window</u>.
<br><p>

The <i>cSurvey</i> export includes the calibration-check shots and media files
(audio and photo).<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>station prefix</u> whether to add a prefix to the station names</li>
</ul><p>


<b id="survex">Survex</b> (.svx)<br>
Survey data can be exported as <i>Survex</i> files.<br>
Data units follow the user options.<br><p>
Import Survex files must have extension ".svx".<br>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>line termination</u> can be either Unix or Windows</li>
<li><u>named TO station</u> for splay shots (the TO name is the FROM station with a letter appended)</li>
<li>add <u>LRUD</u> to export</li>
</ul><p>

<b id="therion">Therion</b> (.th)<br>
Survey data are exported in <i>Therion</i> format, using the data "normal" form.<br>
The TopoDroid survey name is used for the Therion cave name, with underscore '_' replaced by space.<br>
Data units follow the user options.<br><p>

The team names are listed but the command is commented.<br>
The TopoDroid team string is splitted into the Therion <i>team</i> commands: team persons must be listed
with the lastname possibly preceeded by the firstname initial(s). For example
the team string "A.W. Smith, B. Ford" becomes <i>team "A.W. Smith"</i> and <i>team "B. Ford"</i>.<br><p>

Station comments and marks (fixed, painted) precede the centerline data.<br>
X-splays are exported with station "-" (dash), the others with station "." (dot).<br>
Commented shots are exported under comment (#).<br><p>

For the extend the syntax "extend &lt;flag&gt;" is used before any leg, with flag equals to "left", "right",
or "vert". For splays that do not have extend, TopoDroid writes "# extend auto", as a comment because it is not a
valid Therion command.<br><p>

Fractional extend is supported in Therion since v. 5.2.2 and it is exported if it is set.<br><p>

Fixed points coordinates (longitude latitude and altitude a.s.l.) are exported commented.
If the point has custom CRS coordinates, these are included as well, preceded by the CRS name.<br><p>

Furthermore "input" of the th2 files and definitions of maps for each scrap are added at the end, but are commented.<br><p>

The <i>Therion</i> export includes the calibration-check shots, as comment.<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>Therion thconfig</u>: if enabled, the survey data are enclosed in a set of Therion configuration commands.</li>
<li><u>Therion maps</u>: if enabled the "map" commands are placed before the centerline.</li>
<li>add <u>LRUD</u> to export</li>
</ul><p>

<u>thconfig</u><br>
The generated file contains the configuration commands to create the pdf of the plan and extended profile maps.<br>
Running therion on the exported file generates a simple PDF map.<br>
When the thconfig is enabled the input of the sketch files are not commented.<br><p>

Import Therion files must have extension ".th".<br>
The TopoDroid parsing of <i>Therion</i> data syntax is very limited. Only data in "normal" form are understood. The Therion data commands "units", "flag", "extend", "mark" and "station" are supported.<br>
Fixed points ("fix") are parsed but not taken into account as "cs" is not supported.<br><p>


<b id="trobot">TopoRobot</b> (.trb)<br>
Survey data can be exported as <i>TopoRobot</i> files. The <i>TopoRobot</i> station naming policy
must have been selected. If the station names follow TopoRobot convention "series.number", they are used.<br><p>

<b id="vtopo">VisualTopo</b> (.tro)<br>
<i>VisualTopo</i> data file are supported both in import and in export.<br>
Import VisualTopo files must have extension either ".tro" or ".TRO".<br>
VisualTopo splays are included if enabled.<br>
By default LRUD are at the TO station, but they can be set at the FROM station.<br> 
Data units are 'meters' and 'degrees'.<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>splays</u></li>
<li><u>LRUD at From</u></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b id="walls">Walls</b> (.srv)<br>
Survey data can be exported as <i>Walls</i> files (partially tested).<br>
Data units follow the user options.<br><p>

<b id="winkarst">WinKarst</b> (.sur)<br>
Survey data can be exported as <i>WinKarst</i> files (untested).<br><p>


<b id="ptopo">PocketTopo</b> (.top)<br>
TopoDroid supports <i>PocketTopo</i> both in import and in export.<br><p>

PocketTopo export contains only the survey data.<br><p>
If the station naming policy is set to "TopoRobot" and the station names follow TopoRobot convention "series.number"
these are used in the export, otherwise the names are converted to numbers.
Alphabetic characters are replaces each character with two digits. More precisely 'a' goes to '00', 'b' to '01' and so on, 'A' to '50', 'B' to '51', and so on. Every other character (i.e., non-alphanumeric) goes to '99'.<br><p>

Import PocketTopo files must have extension either ".top" or ".TOP".<br>
The "outline" and "profile" sketches are imported.
<i>PocketTopo</i> uses only a few colors to differentiate line types.
Therefore a <a href="page_pt_cmap.htm">mapping</a> from colors to TopoDroid types is used. The mapping can be changed through a setting.<br><p>

It may happen that the imported sketch is not aligned with the survey data. In this case you can shift the sketch in the
<u>sketch window</u>, to fit the centerline.<br><p>


<b id="polygon">Polygon</b> (.cave)<br>
TopoDroid can export survey data in <i>Polygon</i> format. 
Fixed points are exported as lat-long.<br><p>


<b id="ghtopo">GHTopo</b> (.gtx)<br>
TopoDroid can export survey data in <i>GHTopo</i> format (partially tested).<br><p>


<b id="grottolf">Grottolf</b> (.grt)<br>
TopoDroid can export survey data in <i>Grottolf</i> format (untested). 
If the first station has geographical coordinates these are exported, otherwise local coordinates are used.
The profile at the stations are computed by projecting the splay shots onto a vertical plane perpendicular to the
leg.<br><p>


<b id="topo">Topo</b> (.cav)<br>
Survey data can be exported as <i>Topo</i> files.<br><p>

Settings (under "Survex" settings):<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>line termination</u> can be either Unix or Windows</li>

<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>"from" and "to" stations</li>
<li>distance, azimuth, clino</li>
<li>flag</li>
</ul><br>
Shot comments are not exported. A brief header is prepended to the data list.<br>

The survey raw data can be exported in CSV format. In this case each record (line) has
<ul style="margin-top=0">

Survey data can be exported as shapefile. 
There is a shapefile for the stations and one for the shots (both legs and splays).
If the survey contains disjoint pieces, a shapefile is exported for each pieces with a georeferenced station.
Data are corrected with the magnetic declination.
Each shapefile consists of three files: the data file (shp), the index file (shx), and the attributes file (dbf).
The files are zip-compressed and the zip is saved in the folder "shp" with extension ".shz".
<br><p>

If you have georeferenced at least a station and checked the appropriate checkbox in the export dialog,
the data are exported in the WGS84 reference system, and corrected with the magnetic declination.<br>
Otherwise the data are exported in local coordinates and the magnetic declination correction is not applied.<br><p>

<h4>SKETCH EXPORT</h4>

TopoDroid exports survey sketches to the following formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="#csx">cSurvey</a></li>
<li><a href="#th2">Therion</a></li>
<li><a href="#tunnel">Tunnel</a></li>
<li><a href="#xvi">xtherion</a></li>
<li><a href="#cave3d">Cave3D</a></li>
<li><a href="#dxf2">DXF</a></li>
<li><a href="#png">PNG image</a></li>
<li><a href="#pdf">PDF file</a></li>
<li><a href="#shp2">shapefile</a></li>
<li><a href="#svg">SVG</a></li>
</ul>


<b id="csx">cSurvey</b> (.csx)<br>
The cSurvey export files require cSurvey v. 1.20 or later.<br>
These exports contain both the plan and profile sketches, as well as the survey data.
When "section" points are define the section drawings are added at the point.<br>

The cSurvey "cave" attribute is set with the survey name, and the "branch" attribute with the sketch name (without the suffix 'p' or 's').
The midline legs and splays and the sketch items share these attributes.<br><p>

If your survey has only one sketch this is a complete export of your work (except for the x-sections).
If the survey has more than one sketch, you must export each sketch individually and merge the exports with <i>cSurvey</i>.<br><p>

The sketch items are distributed on suitable <i>cSurvey</i> layers.<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>station prefix</u> whether to add a prefix to the station names</li>
<li><u>point spacing</u> maximum distance between interpolating points on smooth lines</li>
</ul><p>

<b id="th2">Therion</b> (.th2)<br>
Sketches are exported in Therion format as one sketch per file, if exported from the <u>sketch window</u>,
or as a file containing all the sketches with the same view, plan or extended, if exported
from the <u>overview window</u>. In the latter there is a scrap for each sketch, and x-section scraps
are included if the automatic "section" points are enabled.
<br><p>

The Therion <i>scrap</i> names are composed of the survey name, the sketch name and a suffix, either 'p', for plan, or 's', for profile.<br>
For multi-scrap sketches the Therion <i>scrap</i> names of the scraps, beyond the first, are appended also a scrap number, beginning
with 1.<br>
X-section Therion <i>scrap</i> names are composed of the survey name, a two letter code, 'xx', and a number.<br><p>

When a sketch with section points is exported through the <u>export</u> dialog, the x-sections of the section points are
also exported.<br><p>

It the sketch contains symbols that are not included in the Therion set, you must prepend the
prefix "u:" to the unsupported symbol names, before using the th2 file.<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>automatic <u>station-points</u>. [default: yes].</li>
<li>add <u>splays</u> to the scrap (as lines of type "splay") [default: no].</li>
<li>add a xtherion command to read the <u>XVI</u> image of the sketch [default: no].</li>
<li>export <u>scale</u>. Default 1:100</li>
<li><u>point spacing</u> minimum distance between points on polylines. Intermediate points are not exported. Default 20 cm</li>
</ul><p>

XVI images are not automatically exported with the Therion "th2" file, even if a xtherion command to include it is added to
the therion file, because it would not contain more information than the therion file.
The command can be used to load in xtherion an XVI image created by another program.
<br><p>

<!--
<u>Note</u>. With version 3.1 TopoDroid saves sketches "natively" in its binary format.<br>
Previous versions used Therion format.
The conversion from Therion to binary is "automatic" when you open a sketch: if TopoDroid does not find the binary file, it looks for the Therion file.<br>
From v. 4.1.2 TopoDroid does not load any more sketches in Therion format.<br>
-->

<b id="tunnel">Tunnel</b> (.xml)<br>
Sketch can be exported in Tunnel XML format. The files are saved in the "tnl" subdirectory.<br>
The following lines are mapped to Tunnel lines: wall, presumed, pit, chimney, and slope. 
All the other lines are mapped to Tunnel line "details".<br>
Area borders are mapped to Tunnel line "filled".<br>
The following points are mapped to Tunnel points: air-draught, archeo, blocks, clay, column, curtain, flowstone, gradient,
guano, mud, pebbles, popcorn, sand, soda-straw, stalactite, stalagmite, water, water-flow.
All the other points are mapped to Tunnel point "bedrock".<br>
<p>

<b id="xvi">Xtherion</b> (.xvi)<br>
The "xvi" export can be inserted as background image in xtherion.<br>
Lines of type "wall" are red, "slope" orange, "section" gray, all others are brown.
Area borders are black.
Point icons are rendered in a simplified way.
Label rendering supports only latin characters and digits and a few characters ('+', '-', '/', '_', '&gt;', '&lt;', '?').
Other characters are replaced by a "diamond".<br>
The grid cell are 1 m.
<br><p>

The XVI settings are among Therion settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>Drawing <u>section-point</u>: if section points are automatically added to section lines,
the section drawing is inserted in the xvi file, at the "section" point</li>
<li><u>grid</u> lines added to the export (cell size in the current grid units). Default no</li>
<li>export <u>scale</u>. Default 1:100</li>
</ul><p>

<b id="cave3d">Cave3D</b> (.c3d)<br>
Sketch exported in "c3d" format can be lifted in the 3D model inside Cave3D.<br>
<br><p>

<b id="dxf2">DXF</b> (.dxf)<br>
Sketches can be exported as 2D DXF files with layers for each point,
line and area type in addition to the layers of the survey data.
The sketch items in the 2D DXF lie in the Z=0 plane.<br><p>

Sketches can be exported as DXF <i>9</i> AC1009, <i>12</i> (R13) AC1012, and <i>14</i> (R14) AC1014.
For DXF-9 areas are exported with only the border and are not colored inside.
<br><p>

It is possible to include in the DXF file, the x-sections (for which the sketch contains a "section" point),
and the X-Y axis.
<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>DXF version: 9 (dxf-9), 12 (dxf-13), or 14 (dxf-14). Default "9"</li>

The setting "levels" affects PNG exports: the export includes only the visible items.<br><p>

Settings:<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><u>image resolution</u> (1 means that 1 m = 40 pixels). The PNG resolution that fits therion th2 export is 5.0.

</ul><p>

<b id="shp2">Shapefile</b> (.shp)<br>
Sketches can be exported as shapefile, with stations, shots, and lines.
Each item has three files: the shape data file, the shape index file, and the database file.
The files comprising the shapefile export are zip-compressed and the zip file is saved in the
folder "shp" with extension ".shz".<br><p>

If you have georeferenced at least a station and checked the appropriate checkbox in the export dialog,
the data are exported in the WGS84 reference system, and corrected with the magnetic declination.<br>
Otherwise the data are exported in local coordinates and the magnetic declination correction is not applied.<br><p>

The "point" DBF contains the fields
<ul style="margin-top=0">

<b id="svg">SVG</b> (.svg)<br>
Sketches can be exported as SVG files.<br>
Items are organized in layers: <i>grids</i>, <i>stations</i>, <i>legs</i>, <i>splays</i>,
<i>points</i>, <i>lines</i>, and <i>areas</i>.<br>
These layers are under a global <i>canvas</i> layer.<br>
Each "scrap" has its  <i>points</i>, <i>lines</i>, and <i>areas</i> layers.<br>
<br><p>

The export scale is 1:100.
<br><p>

If splay classes are enabled, the splays are colored be the class: normal splay are gray,
horizontal are light sea-green, vertical light steel-blue, and xsection light sky blue.
Splay-classes are not supported in "round-trip" export.

<h4>CALIBRATION EXPORT</h4>

<a href="page_calib_import.htm">Calibrations</a> can be exported and imported as CSV files (.ccsv).<br><p>

<h4>IMPORT/EXPORT SETTINGS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><b>PocketTopo</b> <i>import color-map</i>: map of PocketTopo colors to sketch item types.</li> 
<li><i>Estimate LR extend</i>: on import of <b>Compass/VisualTopo</b> files [yes]</li>
<li><i>Default data export format</i>: defines the default format to which data are exported. This file is automatically generated and inserted in the ZIP export.</li>
<li><i>Default sketch export format</i>: defines the default format to which sketches are exported. These files are automatically generated whenever a sketch is closed. This puts some extra load on the system, so you may opt for explicitly exporting sketches after the survey session.</li>
<li><b>Therion</b> <i>map commands</i> before or after the centerline block [after]</li>
<li><b>Therion</b> <i>auto-stations</i>: automatically add station points to the therion sketch file(s) [yes]. If you want to use the sketch files in therion they must have station points to define their scale. You can choose manually which point to add (by editing the sketch drawing), or let TopoDroid add the stations. The program will add all the stations that are "inside" the drawing (inside the drawing convex hull).</li>
<li><b>Therion</b> <i>splays</i> lines in Therion scraps [yes]</li>
<li><b>cSurvey/Compass</b> <i>survey prefix</i> to the stations [no]</li>
<li><b>Compass/TopoRobot/WinKarst/Polygon/VisualTopo</b>
  <ul>
  <li>minimum <i>splay-leg angle</i> for LRUD computation [0.0] This is also used in <b>Survex/Therion</b> if LRUD are required.</li>
  <li>minimun clino of splays used for up/down LRUD [0]</li>
  <li>maximum clino of splays used for left/right LRUD [90]</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Compass swap LR</b>: Swap L and R on Compass export.</li>
<li><b>Survex/Topo</b> <i>line termination</i>: either Unix or Windows [Unix]</li>
<li><b>Survex</b> export with <i>named splay</i> TO stations [no]</li>
<li><b>Survex/Therion</b> export with <i>LRUD</i> lines [no]</li>
<li><b>SVG</b> export with <i>grid</i> [no]</li>
<li><b>SVG</b> export line orientation ticks [no]</li>
<li><b>SVG</b> stroke widths (labels, icons, lines, grids, shots, orientation ticks)</li>
<li><b>KML/GeoJSON</b> export with <i>stations</i> [yes]</li>
<li><b>KML/GeoJSON</b> export with <i>splays</i> [no]</li>
<li><b>PNG</b> <i>resolution</i> [1.5]. It can be a number between 1 and 10. The higher the bigger the image (if you set it too high the system may not have enough memory to create the PNG).</li> 
<li><b>PNG</b> <i>background color</i>: you can set the background color of PNG images by specifying the RGB values (three integers between 0 and 255).</li>
<li><b>DXF</b> sketch export <i>scale</i> [1.0]</li>
<li><b>DXF</b> export with <i>splay endpoints</i> [no]</li>
<li><i>DXF version</i> for the DXF export: either 6, 12, or 16. In version 6 DXF export bezier curves are replaced by polylines and areas do not have hatches. Version 12 and 16 DXF exports use splines and hatches, but they are still buggy.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<h4>3D MODEL EXPORT</h4>

The 3D export dialog is opened by the menu "Export" in the 3D viewer window.<br><p>

The 3D model can be exported as
<ul>
<li>glTF (GL transfer format)</li>
<li>CGAL</li>
<li>STL, either binary or ascii</li>
<li>LAS, binary</li>
<li>DXF</li>
<li>KML (if the model is georeferenced)</li>
<li>Shapefile (if the model is georeferenced)</li>
</ul><br><p>

When supported by the format, the exported file can include 
<ul>
<li>Stations</li>
<li>Splays</li>
<li>Walls (if generated)</li>
<li>Surface DEM (if loaded)</li>
</ul><br><p>
