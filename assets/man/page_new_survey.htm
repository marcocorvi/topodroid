<h4>NEW SURVEY</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Add</i> button in the <u>Main window</u>.<br><p>

Information for the new survey:
<ul>
<li><i>name</i></li>
<li><i>date</i></li>
<li><i>team</i></li>
<li><i>initial station</i></li>
<li>magnetic <i>declination</i></li>
<li>survey <i>description</i></li>
<li>at-station <i>x-sections</i>, shared or private</li>
<li>diving <i>data-mode</i> [T]</li>
<li><i>Trigonometrically calculated azimuths (triangulation)</i></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <i>name</i> is mandatory. 
The survey names are used to list surveys in the
<u>Main window</u> and TopoDroid distinguishes surveys by their name (although each survey has a unique numerical id in the database).<br>
The name must be unique in the database. Names that differ only by the characters case are not different because
the filesystem is case insensitive. TopoDroid raises a warning if the new survey name coincide with the name of an existing survey
except for the characters case.<br><p>

<b>WARNING</b>.
The name of the survey cannot contain spaces, nor the characters '/' (slash, which is the pathname separator), ':' (colon),
'*' (star), and '\' (backslash).
Backslashes are dropped.
Spaces are replaced with '_' (underscore), slashes and colons with dashes '-', and stars with '+' (plus).<br><p>


The <i>date</i> is written with format "yyyy.mm.dd". For example January 6, 2015 is "2015.01.06". It is preset to the current date.<br><p>

The <i>team</i> can be a plain text with the surveyors names, or the names can by separated by commas or semicolon for better
Therion/Survex export. It is also possible to use a <a href="page_team.htm">dialog</a> to enter the separated team names.<br>
The "Team names" setting control how the team field should be entered and how it is handled in the exports.<br>
The <i>team</i> should be filled in, otherwise the dialog has a warning when saved.
The team can be forced to be empty by pressing the "save" button a second time.<br><p>

The <i>description</i> is empty. It can safely be left so, although it is a good practice to take the time to write a description of the survey.<br><p>

The <i>magnetic declination</i> is "unset" by default. If you know it you can enter it here, otherwise you can look it up in the web after you have found the coordinates of a fixed point (say, the cave entrance) with the GNSS [A].
The declination must be entered in decimal degrees.
The accepted range of values is [-360&deg;, 360&deg;].
Any value outside this interval is considered as "unset".<br><p>

At-station <i>x-sections</i> can be either shared among the survey sketches, or private to each sketch.
This choice must be made when the survey is created and cannot be modified later because
it affects the existing sketches.<br><p>

<b>Buttons</b><br>
<i>Save</i>: the new survey name is added to the database.<br>
<i>Open</i>: saves and starts the <i>Shot list</i> activity immediately.<br><p>

<b>Diving data-mode</b> [T/G]<br>
The diving data-mode is an experimental feature.
Data can be entered only manually, and in the following format:
<ul>
<li>FROM station</li>
<li>TO station</li>
<li>depth at the FROM station</li>
<li>azimuth of the direction FROM-TO</li>
<li>distance between the FROM and the TO station</li>
<li>LRUD at the FROM station (optional)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Backshot data are not supported in "diving" data-mode.
<br><p>

<b>Triangulation</b> [T/G]<br>

<p>
  The <i>Trigonometrically calculated azimuths</i> setting is used to enable the azimuths trigonometric calculation for the new survey.
</p>

<p>
  It is useful when working in environments where the compass is not reliable, or when the compass is not available.
</p>
