<h4>DistoX PACKET LOGS</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
This dialog is opened from the <i>Packets</i> menu of the <u>device window</u>.<br><p>

It displays the list of logged packet.
The most recent packets are at the top of the list.
<br><p>

Items with a black background are packets received from the DistoX.
Those with a lighter background are sent to the DistoX.<br>
The text color depends on the type of the packet:
<ul>
<li>white: data packet (D)</li>
<li>grey: vector packet (V)</li>
<li>brown: G packet (G)</li>
<li>orange: M packet (M)</li>
<li>green: command packets (C)</li>
<li>yellow: other packets (X)</li>
</ul><br><p>

DistoX packets are logged only if the <i>Packet</i> setting is enabled.

The dialog has two buttons to clear the log of the packets older than a day or than a week, respectively.
