<h3>[3] DEVICE WINDOW</h3>

Before surveying you need to connect and pair Android with your device and calibrate it.

Tap the <i>Device</i> button in the <u>main window</u> to open the <i>Device Window</i>.
The list of known devices is shown in the middle. 
The supported devices are: DistoX, DistoX2, Sap5, and Bric4.<br><p>

TopoDroid works with one device at a time.
To select it tap on its entry in the list. The name of the selected device is shown at the top, just below the buttons.
If no device is selected, there is a red message saying "Device not selected".<br><p>

If the device list is empty, your device needs to be connected and paired with the Android.
This can be done with the <i>Settings</i> app.<br>
If it does not pair automatically the DistoX PIN is "0000", four zeros.<br>
If it does not pair automatically the Sap5 PIN is "000000", six zeros.<br><p>

<b>Device nickname</b><br>
By default TopoDroid uses the bluetooth MAC address as name for a device.
The devices can be given nicknames to distinguish among several devices more easily.<br><p>

<i>Note. Buttons and menus marked with [*] are specific for the DistoX and need the device to be on.</i><br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>tap on a device entry makes it the active device</li>
<li>long tap on a device antry sets the <a href="page_device_name.htm">nickname</a> or set the "second" DistoX</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><img src="btn_bluetooth.png"> reset bluetooth connection.</li>
<li><img src="btn_info.png"> device information [N,*]</li>
<li><img src="btn_memory.png"> <a href="page_memory.htm">DistoX</a> or <a href="page_bric_memory.htm">Bric4</a> memory functions [*]</li>
<li><img src="btn_toggle.png"> toggle the DistoX calibration mode on and off [*]</li>
<li><img src="btn_compute.png"> DistoX <a href="page_calib_dialog.htm">calibrations</a></li>
<li><img src="btn_read.png"> read and display the calibration coefficients from the DistoX [A,*]</li>
</ul><br><p>

For the DistoX all the buttons are active.<br>
For the Bric4, the first three buttons are active.<br>
For the Sap5 only the first button is active.<br><p> 

If toggling the DistoX calibration mode fails at the first try, repeat it a second time.<br><p>

Reading the device info fails if TopoDroid is connected and downloading data. 
This can happen when te <u>device window</u> is opened from the <u>shot window</u>.
<br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<!-- li><u>Scan</u> for new DistoX devices [N,*]. You might have to try two or three times before the DistoX is found</li -->
<!-- li><u>BLE Scan</u> for new BLE devices [N,*].</li -->
<!-- li><u>Pair</u> the active DistoX with the Android, if not already paired [N,*]</li -->
<li><u>Disconnect</u> clears the active device [A]</li>
<li>Dump and upload <a href="page_firmware.htm">firmwares</a> to the DistoX (v. 2 and BLE) [E,*]</li>
<li>Display log of DistoX packets [T]</li>

<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br>

<h4>DEVICE SETTINGS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><i>Bluetooth</i>: whether to enable, disable, or check on start-up [default "check"]</li>
<li><i>Number of new data</i>: get the number of new data before downloading them (on-demand mode) [default "no"]</li>
</ul><br><p>

The following settings apply only to the DistoX (which uses classical bluetooth).
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><i>Connection mode</i>. "On-demand", "continuous", or "multi" [default "on-demand"]</li>
<!-- li><i>Auto reconnect</i>: automatically reconnect if the connection is lost in "continuous" data download-mode [default "no"]</li -->
<li>DistoX <i>Socket</i> type. Normal or "insecure" [default is "insecure"]</li>
<li>DistoX <i>Z6-workaround</i>: a download timeout error on Z6 phone, and possibly other devices. It is safe to leave this enabled [default "on"]</li>
<!-- li><i>Auto pairing</i>: whether TopoDroid should try to pair with the DistoX selected from a scan [default "no"]</li -->
</ul><br><p>

<b>Connection mode</b><br>
There are three connections modes for the DistoX.
<ul>
<li>in <i>on-demand</i> mode data are downloaded in burst, and when there is no more data to download the connection is closed.</li>
<li>in <i>continuous</i> mode TopoDroid remains connected to the DistoX and the shots are downloaded as soon as they are taken.
If the DistoX and Android disconnect, TopoDroid repeatedly tries to reconnect.
Otherwise, the bluetooth connection is closed.</li>
<li>the <i>multi</i> mode is like the "on-demand" mode, but a long-tap on the "download" button, in the <i>Shot</i> window or in the <i>Sketch</i> window,
changes the DistoX. It you have set a "second" DistoX (in the <i>Device</i> window) it is swapped with the current DistoX.
Otherwise, you get a dialog to pick one among the paired DistoXes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
With the "multi" mode, the current DistoX is shown in the title of the <i>Shot</i> and <i>Sketch</i> windows.<br>
The connection mode applies only to the data download. Other DistoX functions use a one-shot query mode.
<br><p>

Sap5 and Bric4 are always connected in <i>continuous</i> mode.<br><p>
