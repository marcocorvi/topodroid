<h3>[3] DEVICE WINDOW</h3>

Tap the <i>Device</i> button in the <u>Main window</u> to open the <i>Device Window</i>.
The list of known devices is shown at the bottom.<br><p>

<img src="btn_devices.png" height="36" border="1"><br><p>

TopoDroid works with one device at a time.
To select it tap on its entry in the list. The name of the selected device is shown at the top, just below the buttons.
If no device is selected, there is a red message saying "Device not selected".<br><p>

<b>Supported devices</b><br>
TopoDroid uses only devices connected and paired with the Android system.
The devices are selected from the list of devices paired with Android based on their bluetooth name.<br>
The following devices are supported or with support in progress:
<table>
<tr><td><b>Device</b></td><td><b>Bluetooth model</b></td><td><b>Support</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>DistoX v. 1</td><td>DistoX</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>DistoX v. 2</td><td>DistoX2</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>DistoX BLE</td><td>DistoXBLE</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>BRIC 4</td><td>BRIC4</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>BRIC 5</td><td>BRIC5</td><td>untested</td></tr>
<tr><td>SAP 5</td><td>SAP5</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>SAP 6</td><td>SAP6</td><td>partially tested</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cavway X1</td><td>Cavway</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><td>DiscoX</td><td>DiscoX</td><td>under debug [T]</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
TopoDroid does not recognize devices with name that is not one of these.<br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>tap on a device entry makes it the active device</li>
<li>long tap on a device entry opens a <a href="page_device_name.htm">dialog</a> to edit the device properties</li>
</ul><br><p>

<b>Device properties</b><br>
By default TopoDroid uses the bluetooth MAC address as name for a device.
The devices can be given <b>nicknames</b> to distinguish among several devices more easily.<br>
iAlthough TopoDroid works with one device at a time, it allows to set a second working device.
This options makes it faster to switch between the two devices during the surveying.<br>
Finally it is possible to "forget" a device: this effectively removes the device from TopoDroid database
and from the Android connected devices (if was bonded).<br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><img src="btn_bluetooth.png" width="36" border="1"> reset bluetooth connection.</li>

<li><img src="btn_read.png" width="36" border="1"> read and display the calibration coefficients from the DistoX [A,*]</li>
</ul><br><p>

[*] These action need communication with the device.<br><p>

For the <i>DistoX</i> and the <i>Cavway</i> all the buttons are active.<br>
For the <i>BRIC</i>, the first three buttons are active.<br>
For the <i>SAP</i> and the <i>DiscoX</i> only the first button is active.<br><p>

If toggling the <i>DistoX</i> calibration mode fails at the first try, repeat it a second time.<br><p>

Reading the device info fails if TopoDroid is connected and downloading data.
This can happen when te <u>Device window</u> is opened from the <u>Survey Data window</u>.

<b>Bluetooth scan</b><br>
If a BLE device does not show up with its MAC address, it can be discovered with the "BT scan" menu.
To add BLE devices it is enough to do a BT scan with the device on. 
For up to Android-11 the device is not found unless "Location" is active.
The scan lasts a few seconds and the discovered devices appear in the list.
Durin a scan the "Bluetooth" button turns orange, and a press on it ends the scan.<br><p> 

Bluetooth classic devices (DistoX v. 1 and 2) must be connected and paired to Android using the system Setting app.<br>
The <i>DistoX</i> PIN is "0000", four zeros.<br>
The <i>SAP</i> PIN is "000000", six zeros.<br><p>

<h4>DEVICE SETTINGS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><i>Bluetooth</i>: whether to enable, disable, or check on start-up [default "check"]</li>
<li><i>Number of new data</i>: get the number of new data before downloading them (on-demand mode) [default "no"]</li>
</ul><br><p>

The following settings apply only to the DistoX (which uses classical bluetooth).
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><i>Data connection mode</i>. "On-demand", "continuous", or "multi" [default "on-demand"]</li>
<!-- li><i>Auto reconnect</i>: automatically reconnect if the connection is lost in "continuous" data download-mode [default "no"]</li -->
<li>DistoX <i>Socket</i> type. Normal or "insecure" [default "insecure"]</li>
<!-- li>DistoX <i>Z6-workaround</i>: a download timeout error on Z6 phone, and possibly other devices. It is safe to leave this enabled [default "on"]</li -->
<!-- li><i>Auto pairing</i>: whether TopoDroid should try to pair with the DistoX selected from a scan [default "no"]</li -->
</ul><br><p>

<b>Data connection mode</b><br>
There are three connections modes for the DistoX.
<ul>
<li>in <i>on-demand</i> mode data are downloaded in burst, and when there is no more data to download the connection is closed.</li>
<li>in <i>continuous</i> mode TopoDroid remains connected to the DistoX and the shots are downloaded as soon as they are taken.
If the DistoX and Android disconnect, TopoDroid repeatedly tries to reconnect.
Otherwise, the bluetooth connection is closed.</li>
<li>the <i>multi</i> mode is like the "on-demand" mode, but a long-tap on the "download" button, in the <u>Survey Data window</u> or in the <u>Drawing window</u>,
changes the DistoX. It you have set a "second" DistoX (in the <u>Device window</u>) it is swapped with the current DistoX.
Otherwise, you get a dialog to pick one among the paired DistoXes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
With the "multi" mode, the current DistoX is shown in the title of the <u>Survey Data</u> and <u>Drawing windows</u>.<br>
The connection mode applies only to the data download. Other DistoX functions use a one-shot query mode.
<br><p>

<i>SAP</i>, <i>BRIC</i>, and <i>DiscoX</i> are always connected in <i>continuous</i> mode.<br><p>
