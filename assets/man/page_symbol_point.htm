<h4>POINT TOOLS</h4>


The "point" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Two point tools, "user", "section", and "label" (text), are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid private folder <i>point</i>.
This directory is populated with the point tools packaged in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

The point tool file contains lines specifying the property of the drawing tool.
<ul>
<li>"symbol point" [mandatory]</li>
<li>"name NAME", where NAME is the point default name [mandatory]</li>
<li>translated names, eg, "name-es ..." [translated names are optional]</li>
<li>"th_name NAME", where NAME is the Therion name. The filename must be the same as the Therion name, without the possible prefix "u": [mandatory]</li>
<li>"color rgb" (rgb in hex format, for example red is '0xff0000') [mandatory]</li>
<li>"orientation FLAG" [optional, false if missing, true if FLAG is '1' or 'yes']</li>
<li>"has_text FLAG" [optional, false if missing, true if FLAG is '1' or 'yes']</li>
<li>"roundtrip VALUE" [optional, for SVG-roundtrip, VALUE can be 1 (walls_shp), 2 (walls_sym), 3 (detail_shp), 4 (detail_sym) - default 4]</li>
<li>"level" view_flag [optional, viewing level of the point; if missing level is set to 1]</li>
<li>"path" begins the point symbol path. This is specified with the following commands
<ul>
<li>"moveTo X Y"</li>
<li>"lineTo X Y"</li>
<li>"cubicTo X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X Y"</li>
<li>"addCircle X Y R": (X,Y) center, R radius</li>
<li>"arcTo X0 Y0 X1 Y1 FROM_ANGLE SPAN_ANGLE": (X0,Y0 - X1,Y1) bounding rectangle, angles in degrees, 0 along X-axis, direction is CW</li>
</ul>
<li>"endpath" marks the end of the tool path</li>
<li>"endsymbol"</li>
</ul>

<b>Name</b><br>
The English point "name" is mandatory.<br>
Translation of the name in otther languages are optional.<br>
Names must not contain spaces; use underscore '_' in their place.<br>
The Therion name must coincide with the filename. This may cause a problem when the Therion name contains
a dash '-' and this is an illegal character in filenames. In this case use the equal character '=' in the filename,
the script that creates the zip archive of the symbols files replaces '=' with '-' in the filenames.<br>
Therion names and filename must not contain spaces.<br><p>

<b>Orientation</b><br>
If the attribute "orientation" is set, the point symbol can be drawn at an angle, and it can be rotated.<br><p>

<b>Level</b><br>
The "level" attribute takes value the flag for the views enabled on this point items.<br>
The flag is a number sum of 1 (base), 2 (floor), 4 (fills), 8 (ceiling), and 16 (artifacts).
