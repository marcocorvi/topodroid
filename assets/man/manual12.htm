<h3>[12] OVERVIEW WINDOW</h3>

You get into the <u>overview window</u> from the <i>overview</i> menu of the <u>sketch window</u>.
<br><p>

The <u>overview window</u> displays all the sketches together, either in plan or in extended profile view depending on the view of the
<u>sketch window</u>.
The <u>overview window</u> can be either in normal mode (canvas shift and zoom), or in measure-mode.<br><p>

<b>BUTTONS</b><br>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><img src="btn_measure.png"> toggles the window in "measure mode"</li>
<li><img src="btn_mode.png"> references dialog, through which you can switch on/off the display of midline, splay shots, station names, metric grid, and scalebar.  There is also a checkbox to hide the cave details and show the outline only.</li>
<li><img src="btn_angle.png">If "angle", you measure the distance and angle between two points. If "polyline", you measure the total length of a polyline traced by tapping the positions of the nodes</li>
<li><img src="btn_undo.png"> undo: remove the last point of the polyline</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

When the window is in <i>measure mode</i> the first button has a bright green color.
In this mode the drawing can be translated with the side-drag (if enabled) and zoomed with the zoom buttoms (if enabled).
<br><p>

<h4>Segment measure</h4>
When the <u>overview window</u> is in measure-mode you can measure the distance between two points on the canvas.
To do this you tap first on the first point: this is displayed as a pink circled cross. Next you tap on the
second point: this is shown with a blue cross and the 2D distance is shown in the title bar, together with the differences along the X and Y axes, and the bearing (plan) or inclination (extended profile).
The distance units is the the sketch grid units (meter, yard, or 2-ft). The angle is in the current angle units (degrees or grad).<br>
Any further tap changes the second point (and the measure values).<br><p>

To end the measure tap on the "measure-mode" button.<br><p>

The distance is computed in the plane of the canvas. In plan view, this is the horizontal distance. In extended profile view the Y-axis difference is the difference in elevation.<br><p>

<h4>Polyline measure</h4>
The "polyline" measure is useful to get an estimate of the "length" of the cave, more sensible than the length of the midline.
You tap on the start of the polyline and the additional taps mark the nodes of the polyline.
If you make a mistake tap the <i>undo</i> to remove the last points one at a time.<br><p>

The title displays the distance between the two end points, the polyline length, the X-Y displacement between the endpoints, and the angle.<br><p>

<b>Export</b><br>
The overview can be exported in the following formats:
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i></li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>DXF (<i>LibreCAD</i>)</li>
<li>shapefile (<i>QGIS</i>)</li>
<li>xvi (<i>xtherion</i>)</li>
</ul><br>
The sketches are mapped to "scraps" in the Therion export.
Station points are not included automatically in the therion export; only user defined station are added.<br>
The stations are added automatically to SVG, DXF, shapefile, and xvi exports.<br>
If there are "section" points, the x-sections are included.
