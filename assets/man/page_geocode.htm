<h4>Geomorphology code [T]</h4>

This dialog lets you define a geomorphology code to associate
to a photo, or a station, or change it.<br><p>

The list of geomorphology codes are read from the text file "geocodes"
which must be placed in the app private folder.<br><p>

Each line of the "geocodes" file must contain
<ul>
<li>an integer, for the class of the geomorphology</li>
<li>the string of the code (no spaces)</li>
<li>a description of the code (which can have spaces</li>
</ul>

The geomorphology classes are shown with different colors.
Therefore it is advisable to list together the geomorphologies of the same class.<br>
The code is not shown in the interface, but it is stored in the database and the
sketch "tdr" file.<br><p>
