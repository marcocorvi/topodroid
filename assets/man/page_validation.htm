<h4>CALIBRATION VALIDATION</h4>

A calibration can be validated against another calibration of the same DistoX.<br><p>

<b>Calibration list</b><br><p>

With the <u>Validation</u> menu you get the list of the other calibrations of that DistoX,
and you choose which one to validate with, by tapping its entry.<br><p>

<b>Calibration validation result</b><br><p>

The validation result dialog displays
<ul>
<li>(blue) "accuracy" of the second calibration on the data of this calibration. For each group of data
the direction of the average of the group data is computed, as well as those of individual data.
The accuracy is reported as average and std deviation of the difference between the directions
of individual data and that of the average [degrees]</li>
<li>(red) "accuracy" of the current calibration on the data of the second calibration.</li>
<li>(grey) "precision" of the calibrations, measured as average, std deviation and maximum of the angle
differences between the direction computed with the two calibrations, on the data of both.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The yellow vertical line marks 0.5&deg;, and the red line 1.0&deg;.<br>
