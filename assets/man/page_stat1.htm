<h4>SURVEY DATA INFO</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Info</i> button of the <u>Survey Info window</u>.<br><p>

The survey data info are
<ul>
<li>number of (regular) legs, their total length and projected length (on horizontal plane)</li>
<li>number of duplicate legs</li>
<li>number of surface leg</li>
<li>number of splay shots</li>
<li>number of stations</li>
<li>the survey length, that is the leg length not including flagged or repeated legs</li>
<li>number of cycles in the midline graph</li>
<li>number of disconnected surveys (this is 1 if the legs are all attached together in one survey)</li>
<li>number of bluetooth devices used in the survey, and number of data from each device</li>
<li>the first and last dates of the survey data</li>
</ul><br><p>

Length are in the units set in the app settings.<br><p> 

If only one device has been used in the survey, there are also
<ul>
<li>std. deviation of the absolute value of the acceleration field (percent)</li>
<li>std. deviation of the absolute value of the magnetic field (percent)</li>
<li>std. deviation of the magnetic dip angle (degrees)</li>
</ul><br><p>

The last three are also displayed as histograms.
These plots are centered about the mean of the values that falls within the bounds.<br>
The yellow lines mark the value of the accuracy threshold setting (percent for G and M, 
degrees for the dip). These values are shown besides the histograms.<br>
