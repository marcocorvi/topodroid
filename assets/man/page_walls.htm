<h4>Auto-walls</h4>

Auto-walls is a technique to quickly get a rough map of a simple cave, consisting only of the walls outline.
It is not a substitute for a good map sketch.<br><p>  

With auto-walls you tell TopoDroid to draw walls to the right and left of a shots interpolating through the end-points of the splays. At the moment there is only one mechanism, namely "convex" walls. A polyline is traced connecting the outermost end-points of the splays. To create a wall there must be at least one splay end-point on the side of the shot.<br><p>

Auto-walls applies to one shot at a time, and it does not take into account the nearby shots. Therefore it is likely that an auto-wall "enters" the nearby piece of gallery or misses it. You should then edit the auto wall adjusting for these drawbacks, ie, inserting points for the missing pieces and deleting, or moving, points that fall in the neaby gallery.<br><p>

Through the settings you can specify a limit to the inclination of the splays to take into account, and the amount of allowed concavity.<br><p>

<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Walls type</i>: the type of auto-walls. Default is "none" (disabled).</li>
    <li><i>Splay plan threshold</i>: inclination threshold for using splays in auto-walls in the plan view.</li>
    <li><i>Splay profile threshold</i>: inclination threshold for using splays in auto-walls in the profile view.</li>
    <li><i>Point separation</i>: minimum separation of splay points along the shot direction. If two splays are closer than this value only the soplay with largest distance from the shot is used.</li>
    <li><i>Point step</i>: maximum distance along the walls between two line-points. If a wall segment connecting two splays is too long it is splitted interpolating points</li>
    <li><i>Concavity</i>: amount of accetped concavity.</li>
</ul>

Beware that if you draw auto-walls twice for the same shot you get two copies of the wall line(s).
