<h4>GEO_POINT INSERT</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Add</i> button in the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Geo-points</a> window.<br><p>

This dialog has four text fields:
<ul>
<li>longitude</li>
<li>latitude</li>
<li>ellipsoidic altitude</li>
<li>orthometric altitude</li>
</ul>

To the left of the <i>longitude</i> there is button to specify whether the longitude is east (positive)
or west (negative). Tapping the button switches between "E" and "W".<br><p>

To the left of the <i>latitude</i> there is button to specify whether the latitude is north (positive)
or south (negative). Tapping the button switches between "N" and "S".<br><p>

Longitude and latitude can be entered as degrees-minutes-seconds (dd:mm:ss.ss) or as decimal degrees.
Alternative separators for colon are space, single quote, and the degree symbol.
Alternative separators for the decimal point are comma and slash.
<br><p>

Longitude and latitude can have a negative sign.<br><p>

Altitudes are entered in meters. When longitude and latitude are specified, entering one of the two altitudes
causes TopoDroid to automatically compute and display the other.<br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Clipboard</b>: the coordinates saved to clipboard as "lat,long[,alt]" are copied from the clipboard to the
respective text fields. With this button you can use the app <i>GPS-Impetus</i> to get the coordinates (altitude must be
entered manually).</li>
<li><b>View</b> invokes a map app (provided you have one installed) to display the point.</li>
<li>with <b>Proj4</b> you can enter the coordinates in another Coordinate Reference System. The app <i>Proj4</i>
is invoked, and you must select the CRS and enter the coordinates on the left side: longitude/East, latitude/North, and geoid altitude.
Units of altitude and cartographic coordinates are meters. 
Units of geographical coordinates can be either decimal degrees or degree-minute-seconds.
Next you tap the conversion arrow and
the coordinates are converted to geographical WGS84 and sent back to TopoDroid.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> saves a record with the fixed station data in the database.</li>
</ul>
