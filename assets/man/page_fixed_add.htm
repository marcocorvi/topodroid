<h4>LOCATION INSERT</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Add</u> button in the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Locations</a> dialog.<br><p>

This dialog has four text fields:
<ul>
<li>longitude</li>
<li>latitude</li>
<li>ellipsoidic altitude</li>
<li>orthometric altitude</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

To the left of the <b>longitude</b> there is button to specify whether the longitude is east (positive)
or west (negative). Tapping the button toggles between "E" and "W".<br><p>

To the left of the <b>latitude</b> there is button to specify whether the latitude is north (positive)
or south (negative). Tapping the button toggles between "N" and "S".<br><p>

Longitude and latitude can be entered as degrees-minutes-seconds (dd:mm:ss.ss) or as decimal degrees.<br><p>

Altitudes are entered in meters. When longitude and latitude are specified, entering one of the two altitudes
causes TopoDroid to automatically  compute and display the other.<br><p>

With <b>Clipboard</b> the coordinates saved to clipboard as "lat,long[,alt]" are copied from the clipboard to the
respective text fields. With this button you can use the app <i>GSP-Impetus</i> to get the coordinates (altitude must be
entered manually).<br><p>

<b>View</b> invokes a map app (provided you have one installed) to display the point.<br><p>

With the <b>Proj4</b> button you can enter the coordinates in  another Coordinate Referernce System. The app Proj4
is invoked, and you select the CRS and enter the coordinates on the left column. Next you tap the conversion arrow and
the coordinates are converted to long-lat and sent back to TopoDroid.
<br><p> 

<b>Save</b> saves a record with the fixed station data in the database.<br><p>
