<h4>SAVED STATIONS</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Station</i> button in the <u>Survey Data window</u>,
or from the <i>edit station</i> dialog of the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

The "saved stations" are station names saved for later reference, eg, at a crossway, to go back and continue the
survey from there, or to mark a possible lead to check in a future trip.<br><p>

<b>Note</b> The names of stations attached to shots or to "saved stations" are just names
and do not identify entities. Therefore, when a station name of a shot is changed,
the same name in a "saved station" does <u>not</u> change.
<br><p>

The dialog displays the list of saved stations. You select one by tapping it.<br><p>

The selected station is shown in the text fields.
Opened from the <u>Survey Data window</u>, the text field contains the last station, or the active station if this is set.
Opened from the edit-station dialog, the text field contains the station.<br><p>

Each saved station must have a brief description (comment) or a flag set.<br>
It is possible to assign a geocode to a saved station [T].<br><p>

<ul>
<li>the selected <b>station</b></li>
<li>the station <b>flag</b>, if any ("fixed" or "painted")</li>
