<h4>EXTEND REFERENCE</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <u>Azimuth</u> button either in the survey <u>data window</u>
or in the <u>sketch window</u>.<br><p>

The extend reference is used to assign the profile "extend" direction to the midline legs.<br>
The "extend" direction is not automatically set for the splays.<br><p>

The <i>Azimuth</i> button displays either a long arrow inside a circle, oriented to the 
current extend reference direction, or a short arrow directed left or right (for fixed "extend").<br>
When the profile "extend" is compute using the "extend reference" it is set to right if it differs from the
reference by less than 90&deg;. Otherwise it is set to left.
<br><p>

When the <i>Fixed extend reference</i> setting is enabled, the <i>Azimuth</i> button has only two states, either LEFT or RIGHT.
Tapping the button switches between them. The new shots extend is set according to the state
of the button.<br><p>

This dialog has
<ul>
<li>"extend reference" <b>azimuth</b></li>
<li>slider to change its value between -180 and 180&deg;</li>
<li><b>text field</b> to enter the azimuth numerical value, between 0 and 360</li>
<li><b>compass</b> sets the value using the Android magnetic sensors</li>
<li><b>left</b> forces "extend" to LEFT (-1)</li>
<li><b>right</b> forces "extend" to RIGHT (+1)</li>
<li><b>ok</b>: use the azimuth for the "extend"</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b>Sketch extend reference mode</b><br>
The extend reference azimuth can be changed also in the plan view of a sketch [E].
A long tap on the <i>Azimuth</i> button turns the window in "extend reference" mode. In this mode an
finger slide across the display rotates the reference azimuth (the canvas is not shifted).
To get out of this mode lift the finger from the screen.<br><p>

<b>Leg extend</b><br>
When a new shot is downloaded TopoDroid sets its "extend" automatically.
This holds also for shots entered manually, if the "extend" in the shot dialog is left "unset".
By default the "extend" is either LEFT, RIGHT, or VERT (vertical), depending on the angle the shot makes with the reference azimuth.<br>
If the angle is smaller than 90&deg; minus the <i>extend vertical threshold</i> the leg is extended RIGHT.
If it is larger than 90&deg; plus the <i>extend vertical threshold</i> the leg is extended LEFT.
Otherwise it is extended VERT.<br><p>

The <i>Extend Reference</i> dialog allows to change the reference azimuth, by rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise.
Alternatively, the reference azimuth can be set using the Android compass sensors.
A warning is shown if the sensor accuracy is low or there is a sensor failure.
<br><p>

It is also possible to fix the "extend" for coming shots to either LEFT or RIGHT, by selecting the appropriate buttons in the dialog.<br><p>

<b>Splay extend</b><br>
The "extend" of splay shots is determined according to that of the legs at the splay station and the azimuth between the splay and the legs.
The splay is extended as if it were projected on the closest of the vertical planes passing through the legs.<br><p>
