<h4>DRAWING TOOL SETS</h4>

TopoDroid comes with six sets of drawing tools:
<ul>
<li>speleology</li>
<li>archeology</li>
<li>geology</li>
<li>biology</li>
<li>paleonthology</li>
<li>mining</li>
</ul>

By default only the speleology tools are installed.
<br>
With the "PALETTE" menu of the main window you get a dialog to install additional tools.
Check the tool sets you want to add and press the button "Install".
<br>
If you press the button "Replace" the currently installed tools are removed before
installing those you selected.
<br>
<p>

After installing you must enable the tools you need, using the "Palette" button
of the main window. The choice of enabled tools is stored in the database and is not lost when 
tools are removed.
