<h4>DRAWING TOOL SETS</h4>

The drawing tools are divided in three <i>types</i>: points, lines, or areas (regions).<br>
The point tools are stored in the <i>point</i> subdirectory of the private app <i>files</i><br>
The line tools are stored in the <i>line</i> subdirectory, and the area tools in the <i>area</i> subdirectory of the private app <i>files</i><br>
<p>

TopoDroid comes with one default set of drawing tools, and other eight additional sets [T].
Overall that makes more than 200 points, 60 lines, and 30 areas.
The basic speleology set has about 40 points, 15 lines, and less than 10 areas.
<br><p>

The drawing tool files are stored in the subfolders of <i>com.topodroid.TDX/files</i>.
These files can be edited and modified, or even deleted.
Furthermore, if other custom tool files
are placed in the proper subfolder, TopoDroid will load and use them.
<br><p>

Eight <i>system</i> tools are always present:
the three "user" symbols, points "label" and "section",
lines "wall" and "section", and area "water".
These tools are not stored as files, and cannot be changed.
A custom tool file with the same name as one of these tools is skipped.
<br><p>

By default only the speleology tools are installed.
The installation of additional tools is enabled through a setting [G].
A few tools are included in more than one set.
The additional symbol sets are provided mostly as examples of custom symbols.
<br><p>

To install additional tool sets tap the
the <i>PALETTE</i> menu [G] of the <u>Main window</u>.
The coming dialog lists the sets of tools.
Check the tool sets you want to add and press the button <i>Install</i>.
<br>
If you press the button <i>Replace</i> the currently installed tools are
removed before installing the tool sets you selected.
<br>
<p>

After installing new tool sets you must enable the tools you need, using the
<i>Palette</i> button of the <u>Main window</u>.
The choice of enabled tools is stored in the database and is not lost when 
tool files are removed, therefore you will find them enabled if you re-install
the set later.
<br><p>

<b>Tool groups</b>
The tools of each type are further divided in <i>groups</i> (classes).
A tool can belong to a group or have no group.
<br><p>

Groups are used in one way:
<ol>
<li>when a sketch is opened, and an item type is not found, TopoDroid tries to substitute
it for another type in the same group. If there is none, the "user" tool is used.</li>
</ol>
<br><p>

The tools groups are displayed in the tool enabling dialog.
Group names are in English.
