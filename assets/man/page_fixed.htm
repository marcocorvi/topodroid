<h4>LOCATION EDIT</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping a fixed point entry in the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Locations list</a> dialog.<br><p>

The dialog shows
<ul>
<li>longitude, latitude and geoid altitude. WGS84 ellipsoid altitude in square brackets</li>
<li>point <b>name</b> and <b>comment</b></li>
<li>magnetic <b>declination</b> at the point (at the current date)</li>
</ul><br><p>

Buttons
<ul>
<li><b>View</b> the point in a Location app (provided you have one installed)</li>
<li><b>Clear</b> converted coordinates. This action is immdiate.</li>
<li><b>Convert</b> the position to another reference system (using the app Proj4)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the location record</li>
</ul>

If the coordinates of the fixed point have been entered manually, they can be edited.
Coordinates taken with GPS or imported from <i>MobileTopographer</i> cannot be changed.<br><p>

The orthometric altitude is computed from the ellipsoidic altitude using the geoid model EGM2008.<br><p>

The <b>Convert</b> button computes the point coordinates in another Coordinate Reference System,
using the app Proj4. The converted coordinates are displayed and stored in the database with the fixed point.<br><p>

The magnetic declination is computed using the World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020 (this will be replaced 
with WMM 2020-2025 in Jan. 2020).
The uncertainty of the WMM model declination can be as large as 0.4 degrees in temperate ragions.<br>
Check the <b>save</b> box to set it to the survey.<br><p>

The <b>Save</b> button commits the changes to the database.<br><p>
