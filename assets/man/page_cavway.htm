<h4>CAVWAY REFERENCE GUIDE</h4>

<i>Here is a summary of the <i>Cavway</i> functions.<br>
The official user manuals are available at http://cavedevice.com</i>
<br><p>

The <i>Cavway</i> has five buttuns,
<ul>
<li>"DIST"</li>
<li>"Left" (&lt;)</li>
<li>"Right" (&gt;)</li>
<li>"Memory/Confirm" (M)</li>
<li>"Clear" (CLR)</li>
</ul>

To turn the <i>Cavway</i> on press the "DIST" button.
To turn it off press and hold the "CLR" button.
The <i>Cavway</i> goes off by itself after the amount of time on inactivity defined with the <i>Idle off</i> option.
<br><p>

The switch off and lock the <i>Cavway</i> press and hold the buttons "CLR" and "&gt;".
To unlock it, after pressing the "DIST" press "M" within two seconds.<br<p>

The <i>Cavway</i> interface is menu based, with several screen-pages.<br><p>

<b>Button Functions</b><br>
<ul>
<li>"DIST": turn on the laser; take a mesurement</li>
<li>"&lt;" and "&gt;" are used mostly as navigation button used to move in the menus</li>
<li>when in measurement mode a tap on "&lt;" or "&gt;" turns the device in memory mode.</li>
<li>"M" enters the menu page and is used mostry to confirm choices.</li>
<li>"CLR" goes back to the previous screen.</li>
<li>a long tap on "&lt;" shows the details of the current measurement</li>
<li>a long tap on "&gt;" clears the untransmitted flag on all shots</li>
</ul>

<b>Measurement</b><br>
Press "DIST" to turn on the laser. Press it again to take a measurement. The readings are shown on the screen.
If the <i>Cavway</i> detects an anomaly (a discrepancy between the readings of the two sensor sets), it shown an
error message on the screen.<br>
By pressing the "M" button while the laser is on, the user can select among four flags to mark the shot that is
being taken.<br><p>

<b>Memory mode</b>
In this mode the <i>Cavway</i> shows the values (distance, azimuth and clino) of five shots.
The first column contains "E" if an error was detected, or "C" for calibration shots.
The shot that have not been transferred yet have a "*" to the right.
Leg shots are in bold.<br>

The shot under cursor has a dark background. The buttons "&lt;" and "&gt;" scroll up and down the list.
Pressing "M" the details of the shot under cursor and shown: readings, detected errors, and values og G/M/dip.<br><p>

<b>Menu mode</b><br>
The first menu-screen has five menus
<ul>
<li>"Calibration", to start a calibration</li>
<li>"Clr. Unsent", to clear the not-transmitted flag from all shots</li>
<li>"Options", to change the device settings</li>
<li>"Info", to see device informations (fw, hw, serial number, battery voltage, and so on)</li>
<li>"Advan. Menu" to move to the second menu-screen</li>
</ul>
<p>

The second menu-screen has 
<ul>
<li>"Shot Options", settings for shots</li>
<li>"Calib. Options"</li>
<li>"Time" to set the date and the time</li>
<li>"Units"</li>
<li>"Factory Reset"</li>
</ul>
<p>

The device options are 
<ul>
<li>"Reference" point: rear, (extension) tail, tripod screw, fronjt, custom</li>
<li>"Shot delay", from 0 to 9 seconds</li>
<li>"Screen backlight", from 0 (no backlight) to 10</li>
<li>"Volume" (beep sound), either ON or OFF</li>
<li>"Ide timeoff", 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 seconds</li>
</ul>
The buttons "&lt;" and "&gt;" move among the options. The button "M" cycles through the values of the setting.<br><p>

The shot options are
<ul>
<li>"Error detection", either ON or OFF</li>
<li>"Angle difference" for leg identification</li>
<li>"ABS G/M" error limit</li>
<li>"Dip" error limit</li>
<li>"Reset to default"</li>
<li>"Reset statistics</li>
</ul><p>

The calibration options are
<li>
<li>"Error detection", either ON or OFF</li>
<li>"Group detection" angle limit</li>
</ul><p>

<b>Calibration</b><br>
The "Calibration" menu turns the <i>Cavway</i> in calibration mode.
In this mode the device registers raw readings in groups of four, as long as the angle difference between shots
in the same group is small.
If more than four shots are taken the device recrds only the last four.<br>
When a group of four is complete, a new group is started when there is a shot with a different direction.<br>
The distribtion of group directions is shown on the screen with two circles, one for positive inclinations, the
other for negative inclinations.<br>
The group shot count can be reset by pressing the "&gt;" button.<br>
The <i>Cavway</i> records at most 25 groups.<br>
The button "M" starts the computation of the calibration coefficients. Afterwards it shows the results of the
computation: average angle error, std deviation and maximum angle error.<br>
Another press of the button "M" stores the comuted coefficients.<br>
The button "CLR" exits from the calibration mode.<br<p>
