<h4>DRAWING TOOLS PALETTE</h4>

The drawing tools bundled in the program include about 9 areas, 16 lines and 46 points.<br><p>

When the app starts the first time it installs the drawing tools files in the "symbol" directory. There are files for points (iconic symbols, like "entrance", or "stalagmite"), lines (like "wall", or "pit"), and areas (regions shown with a transparent color).<br><p>

New versions of the drawing tools are not automatically installed, but there is button to update them.
The coming dialog tells you the installed and the current version and asks whether to update the drawing tools.<br><p>

It is likely you do not need many of them, or maybe you need different ones. You can customize the drawing tools and the way you select them in four ways:
<ul>
<li>with the choice of main drawing tools (dialog)</li>
<li>at the level of the survey/sketch</li>
<li>at the level of the project (directory)</li>
<li>on the file system</li>
</ul>

The drawing tools are loaded from files in the app private folder.<br>
When the drawing tools files are updated, TopoDroid does not install the new tools, automatically.<br><p>


<b>Global palette</b><br>

Except for the "system" tools, TopoDroid loads the drawing tool from files stored in the "symbol" subdirectory of
the app private folder.<br>
The system tools are the "user", "label" and "section" points, "user", "wall" and "section" lines, "user" and "water" areas.
These are always enabled.<br><p>

The <i>tools</i> button of the <u>Main window</u> opens the dialog to enable the drawing tools.<br>
You have to do this independently for points, lines, and areas<br><p>

When a new sketch is created its palette is initialized with the enabled tools of the global palette.<br><p>


<b>Survey drawing tools</b><br>

The drawing tools enabled at survey level are the global palette, by default.<br>

If you open an old sketch that has tools that are not enabled by default, these are added to the survey palette.<br><p>


<b>Sketch drawing tools dialog</b><br>

The tools bottom bar contains only six drawing tools (for each type).
If you need to use another tool, you must go to the <a href="page_tools_list.htm">drawing tools dialog</a>
which display the list of the drawing tools, subdivided under three tabs: Point, Line and Area.<br>

Each tool shows the iconic symbol, the tool name, and the tool-group if any.
<br>

When you start a new sketch it gets the tools configured in the survey palette.<br><p> 


<b>Sketch palette</b><br>

Each sketch has its own palette.  When you close the sketch it is saved with a header listing its palette.
When you reopen it, the palette is merged with the survey palette.
If the sketch contains items which are not enabled in the survey palette they are added to the survey palette.
If an item' tool is not among the main drawing tools, it is replaced with the "user" tool.
The "user" tools (point, line and area) are always in the palette.<br><p>

The sketch palette is specified through the <i>PALETTE</i> menu of the <u>Drawing window</u>.
This opens a dialog that lets you decide which tool enable in the sketch palette.
You switch on and off the tools to your needs then close the dialog (with the <i>BACK</i> button) to save the changes.
You have to do this independently for points, lines and areas.<br><p>


<b>Custom drawing tools</b><br>

At a even higher level you can customize the tool files, and write your own tool files.<br>
The tool files are plain text files, stored in the app private folder under "/sdcard/Android/data".
The syntax of the tool files is described in this page: <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/topolinux/wikis/TopoDroidSymbols.wiki">https://code.google.com/archive/p/topolinux/wikis/TopoDroidSymbols.wiki</a><br><p>

Even if TopoDroid comes with many drawing tools preinstalled, it can happen that it does not contains the tools you need (or you do not like the provided ones).
You can modify them, delete those you do not need, and write and add new ones (for tools not included in the program).
After a cold restart, TopoDroid will see and use them.<br><p>

If you modify a tool file or write a new tool file that may be useful to other users, consider making a pull request on the TopoDroid github repository.<br><p>

The "system" drawing tools cannot be modified, nor deleted.<br><p>

<b>Addional symbol sets</b><br>
TopoDroid comes with these additional symbol sets:
<ul>
<li>Extra speleo symbols</li>
<li>Mining symbols</li>
<li>Geology symbols</li>
<li>Archeology symbols</li>
<li>Anthropic symbols</li>
<li>Paleology symbols</li>
<li>Biology symbols</li>
<li>Karst symbols</li>
</uL><br>

In order to install additional symbol sets, the custom setting "Palette" must be enabled.<br><p>
