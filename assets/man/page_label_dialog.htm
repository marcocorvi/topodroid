<h4>SKETCH LABELS EDIT</h4>

This dialog is opened when you edit a label, in drawing mode of the <u>Drawing window</u> by selecting it and then clicking in the <i>Note</i> button.<br><p>

Label properties:
<ul>
<li><b>size</b>: one of XS, S, M, L, XL</li>
<li><b>orientation</b></li>
<li><b>text</b></li>
<li><b>layers</b>, canvas views, available when the "Layers" setting is set to "by item" [T]</li>
<li>additional <i>Therion</i> <b>options</b></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>
The canvas views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code.
By default, labels belong to the "base" and "artifact" views.
It is possible to switch off some views.
<br><p>
Beware that, if the label is not assigned to a visible view, it will not appear in the canvas
even if it is actually added to the sketch. In this case, however, the label point will be visible in edit mode, so that 
the label edit dialog can be opened and the label assigned to a canvas view.
