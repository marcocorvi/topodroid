<h4>DATA DOWNLOAD</h4>

The <i>Download</i> button starts a connection with the device to download data.
While the connection is active it stays red. If you are using the <i>on-demand</i> download-mode the connection is closed when there are no more data to retrieve.
With the <i>continuous</i> download-mode the connection remains open (and data are continuously downloaded as soon as they are taken)
until the device and the Android lose the Bluetooth connection.  Which mode is best suited for you depends on your habits.
With the <i>on-demand</i> mode you can concentrate on sketching and other tasks without being bothered by incoming data, and when you download the data
you can focus on them (they are highlighted blue). On the other hand <i>on-demand</i> download requires pauses to get the data,
and these are especially long if you took several shots in the between.<br><p>

When the Bluetooth connection with the device is broken (eg. the device gets too far from the Android, or it is switched off)
in <i>on-demand</i> mode, the data download is interrupted.
In <i>continuous</i> mode TopoDroid retries to connect to the device every few seconds.<br><p>

When the survey <u>data window</u> is closed the data download connection is terminated. The download connection is not interrupted when the
window is paused (the display switches off). If you open a sketch while the download connection is active in <i>continuous</i> mode,
the connection is maintained and the data are downloaded (and displayed in the sketch).<br><p>

For the <i>Sap5</i> and <i>Bric4</i> data are always downloaded in <i>continuous</i> mode.<br><p>

<b>Bric4</b><br>

The data download from the <i>Bric4</i> can be limited to only the essential values (distance, azimuth, clino, and little more), or
complete, with all the information transferred by the Bric4 protocol.<br>
The complete protocol includes the "index" of the shot. By default TopoDroid uses the <i>Bric4</i> index as data index
in the database table, if it receives it. Since the data index must be unique, if TopoDroid receives a shot with an index that
is already in the database, a novel value is used instead of the <i>Bric4</i> index.<br><p>

The Bric4 index can be reset with the <i>Advanced menu | Memory clear</i> BRIC4 command.<br><p>

It is possible to disable the use of the <i>Bric4</i> index [G], and let TopoDroid assign incremental values to the data index.<br><p> 

<u>WARNING</u>. The first shot after a Bric4 "memory clear" does not arrive to TopoDroid.<br><p>
