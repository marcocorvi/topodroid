<h4>Most recent tools picker</h4>

This dialog is used to select the current drawing tool.<br>
It is opened tapping the <u>Tool</u> button in the <i>Sketch</i> window (in "drawing" mode), provided the "tool picker" setting is set accordingly.<br><p>

This dialog displays the icons of the most recently used points, lines and areas on three rows.
<ul>
<li>The point icons are the iconic symbols</li>
<li>The line icons are short segments drawn with the line style</li>
<li>The area icons are ellipses filled with the area color or pattern. If the area is closed horizontally the icon is the lower half of the ellipses</li>
</ul><br><p>


You select a tool by tapping its icon. A long tap on an icon brings it in front of the list and
the tool name is shown on the title.<br><p>

Each row has a button to the right to go to the list of all tools, so that you can choose one of the others.<br><p>

The slider on top adjusts the orientation of the first point tool, if this is orientable.<br><p>

If you need to rotate an orientable area, you must go the list tool picker interface.<br><p>

<b>+/-</b>: change icon size cycling through XS, S, M, L, XL.<br><p>
