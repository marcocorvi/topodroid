<h4>SKETCH RENAME/DELETE/SPLIT</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
With this dialog you can change the name of a sketch.
It is opened from the <i>Rename</i> menu of the <u>sketch window</u>.<br><p>

It has a field for the new name of the sketch,
and a text box with the sketch reference station (sketch origin).<br>
The reference station can be modified only at "Tester" level.<br><p> 

Type the new sketch name in the edit box, and tap the <i>Apply</i> button to confirm.<br><p>

The <i>Split</i> button [T] lets you cut a portion of the sketch and save it as a new sketch.
You must write the name of the new sketch in the edit box.
Then you select the portion of the sketch by tracing a line around it.<br>
With the check box you choose whether to copy or to move the selected items to the new sketch.<br><p>

The base station of the new sketch is the same as that of the current sketch.<br>

The <i>Delete</i> button marks the sketch as "deleted". It can be recovered with the survey <u>data window</u>
<i>recover</i> menu.<br><p>

Close the dialog with the <i>Cancel</i> button to cancel.<br><p>

<!-- b>Base station </b><br><p>

At <i>Tester</i> level the sketch base station can be changed.<br>
Beware that changing the base station
shifts the centerline, and the section lines and points since these reference the shifted legs 
and stations. The other items of the sketch are not shifted.
