<h4>SURVEY DATA DISPLAY MODE</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Reference</i> button in the survey <u>data window</u>.<br><p>

<ul>
<li><b>shot id</b></li>
<li><b>splay</b>: shots with only one station</li>
<li><b>blank</b>: shots with no stations</li>
<li><b>repeated leg</b>: shots close to the preceding leg</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The shot id's are unique increasing indices assigned by TopoDroid to the shots of the survey.<br><p>
  
If the splay shots are hidden it is still possible to show the splay
shots for an individual station. Tapping on the station name in a leg shot, makes the splay shots at that station visible.
Tapping again on the station name (even in a splay shot) hides them.<br><p>
