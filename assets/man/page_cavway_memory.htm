<h4>Cavway Memory</h4>

The Cavway X1 memory dialog allows retrieving the latest data from the device memory.
You must specify the number of data to download and press the button "Dump".
The data are shown in the dialog.<br><p>

For survey data date, distance, azimuth, inclination, roll and the two dip values are shown.
Leg data has an 'L' in front. If the shot has an error, there is an 'E'.
Calibration data have a 'C', the date, and the raw sensor readings: G1, M1, G2, and M2.<br><p>


It you specify the name for a dumpfile, the data is also stored in the file.
