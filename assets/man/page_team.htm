<h4>TEAM DIALOG</h4>

The team dialog allows entering team names without bothering about separators between names.
The program takes care of combining the team names in a string with proper separators.<br><p>

The characters comma (',') and semicolon (';') are reserved for separators and must not be used
inside names.<br><p>
