<h4>AREA TOOLS</h4>

The "area" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Two area tools, "user" and "water", are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid private folder <i>area</i>.
This directory is populated with the area tools packaged in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

The area tool file contains lines specifying the property of the drawing tool.
<ul>
<li>"symbol area" line [mandatory]</li>
<li>"name NAME", where NAME is the area default name [mandatory]</li>
<li>translated names, eg, "name-es ..." [optional]</li>
<li>"th_name NAME", where NAME is the Therion name. The filename must be the same as the Therion name, without the possible prefix "u": [mandatory]</li>
<li>"color rgb alpha" (rgb and alpha in hex format, for example '0x0000ff' is blue, and '0x99' is semi-transparent) [mandatory]</li>
<li>"close-horizontal" [optional, false if missing]</li>
<li>"orientable" [optional, false if missing]</li>
<li>"level" view_flag [optional, 1 if missing]</li>
<li>"bitmap WIDTH HEIGHT X_TILE Y_TILE" starts of the bitmap pattern. The tile modes can be M (mirror) or R (repeat). This line must be followed by HEIGHT lines of length WIDTH with the bitmap pixels (1: foreground, 0: background).</li>
<li>"endbitmap" marks the end of a bitmap</li>
<li>"roundtrip VALUE" [optional, for SVG-roundtrip, VALUE can be 1 (walls_shp), 2 (walls_sym), 3 (detail_shp), 4 (detail_sym) - default 3]</li>
<li>"endsymbol"</li>
</ul>

<b>Name</b><br>
Refer to the <a href="page_symbol_point.htm">Point Tool</a> for how to specify the names.
<br><p> 

<b>Close-horizontal</b><br>
If this attribute is set the area border is closed horizontally in the profile view
and in the x-sections.<br>
If the Y coordinate of the last point of the drawn line is close to that of the first point,
the area border is interrupted at the first point that has the Y coordinate close to that of the 
first point.
By this means you can draw areas with a flat horizontal top (or bottom) profile.<br>
If the Y coordinates of the drawn line endpoints differ too much, the border is closed with a 
slant segment.<br><p>

Currently, this attribute it is only set for the built-in "water" tool.<br><p>

<b>Bitmap pattern</b><br>
With this option you can specify a background pattern, eg, for differentiating rock
formations.<br><p>

Area patterns are not used in the default symbol set.
Shading (as defined through the "color" attribute) is preferred for performance instead of tiling (as defined through the "bitmap" attribute).<br><p>

This attribute is not used in any tool packaged in the apk.<br><p>

<b>Orientation</b><br>
If the attribute "orientable" is set, the area pattern can be rotated through the area edit dialog.<br>

<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>
The "level" attribute has value the flag for the views enabled on this area items.<br>
The flag is a number sum of 1 (base), 2 (floor), 4 (fills), 8 (ceiling), and 16 (artifacts).
