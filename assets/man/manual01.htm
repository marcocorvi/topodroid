<h3>[1] INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4>Activity levels</h4>
The TopoDroid interface has activity levels, differing by the number of actions that are enabled.
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>At the <b>basic</b> level [B] drawing is limited to lines, with no editing actions.</li>
<li>The <b>normal</b> level [N] contains all the functions for a detailed cave survey.</li>
<li>The <b>advanced</b> level [A] has also advanced functions.</li>
<li>The <b>expert</b> level [E] has all the functions.</li>
<li>The <b>tester</b> level [T] is only for development test. It has untested features enabled. These features are partly debugged and may crash the app. Please report any problem with them.</li>
</ul><br>
By default TopoDroid has only the <b>normal</b> functions enabled, but you can switch level, according to your needs, without exiting from the program. This manual describes the complete TopoDroid. Features at a level above "basic" are marked with the level initial, [N], [A], [E], or [T].<br>
The settings displayed in the <u>preferences window</u> depend on the activity level.<br><p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
TopoDroid has a <u>main window</u> from which you can move to other app activities.  The main activities are:
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><b>Survey</b> data management (survey <u>info</u> and <u>data</u> windows).</li>
<li><b>Sketch</b> drafting, <u>drawing window</u>, is a sub-activity of the Survey activity.</li>
<li><b>Device</b> functions, <u>device window</u></li>
<li><b>Calibration</b> of DistoX (calibration <u>info</u> and <u>data</u> windows) is a sub-activity of the Device activity.</li>
</ul><br>

TopoDroid windows have a scrollable button bar at the top, for the most frequent actions, and a menu button at the top-right.
Dialogs usually have a confirmation button (<i>OK</i> or <i>Save</i>).
If there are both, <i>OK</i> saves the input data and closes the dialog, while <i>Save</i> saves the input data and keep the dialog open for a new input.<br>
Dialogs can have also a <i>back</i> (or <i>cancel</i>) button. If not present, the Android <i>BACK</i> button saves the changes and closes the dialog.
Otherwise it just closes the dialog.<br><p>



<h4>Help and user manual</h4>
TopoDroid windows have a menu button (three vertical dots) at the top-right. The last menu opens a quick help about the actions of the window buttons and menus.
The quick-help dialog has a "book" button at the top-right which opens the user manual at the relevant page.
A long tap on the icon opens the manual at the first page.<br>
If your Android has a <i>Menu</i> key, you can use also that to open the man page.<br>
<br><p>

For the dialogs the hardware <i>Volume Up</i> key opens the <i>User Manual</i> at the relevant page.
If your Android has a <i>Menu</i> key, you can use that as well.<br>
For the dialogs with the row of the action buttons of a slightly darker color, the man page can be opened by a long tap
on that row.<br><p>


<h4>Settings</h4>
TopoDroid has a large number of settings.
These are divided in categories and subcategories:
<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Survey data</li>
<li>Sketches</li>
<li>Devices and calibration</li>
<li>Import/Export</li>
</ul><p>

The number of settings displayed by the "Settings" interface depends on the activity level.<br><p> 

<div style="font-size: 90%">
More esoteric settings (<a href="page_geek.htm">Geek</a>) are marked with [G].
They are collected under the <i>Custom settings</i> section.
</div>
<br><p>


<h4>Text and Buttons size</h4>
The "Text Size" setting specifies the dimension of the list text entries, in particular the list of surveys, that of shots, and that of calibration data.<br>
There are five choices for the size of buttons: "small", "normal", "medium", "large", and "huge". The "normal" size is suitable for cell phones (5' screen), and is the default. The "large" size is for tablets (7' screen).<br><p>

<h4>Drawing tools (palette)</h4>
TopoDroid comes with a considerable number of drawing tools bundled in.
By default only the most basic tools are enabled. 
You can enable more tools as the need arises, with the <i>palette</i> button on the <u>main window</u>.
By this means you can get used to the TopoDroid "iconography" a bit at a time.
<br><p>

Additional drawing tool sets can be installed in the palette.
Custom tools can be also created and added to the palette, and tools with no use can be removed.<br><p>
