<h4>SKETCH EXPORTS</h4>

Sketches are stored in TopoDroid binary format, and can be exported as
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i> ".th2" file</li>
<li><i>cSurvey</i> ".csx" file</li>
<li><i>Tunnel</i> ".xml" file</li>
<li>2D DXF (<i>LibreCAD</i>)</li>
<li>SVG (<i>Inkscape</i>)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>shapefile (<i>QGIS</i>)</li>
<li><i>xtherion</i> image ".xvi"</li>
<!-- li>PNG image file</li -->
</ul><br><p>


In addition to the export, there
is an option to automatically save a sketch in one of the supported export formats whenever it is closed.<br><p>

The <b>cSurvey</b> export file contains both the plan and the profile sketches. If the "section" points are defined, it has also the x-sections.
X-sections are not exported as cSurvey files.<br><p>

<!--
The resolution of <b>PNG</b> images is an adjustable setting. However a larger and more detailed image requires more CPU time and may fail due to memory limits. If it fails TopoDroid tries reducing the resolution until it succeeds exporting the sketch as PNG image file.<br><p -->

Sketches can be exported as 2D <b>DXF</b> files. Supported DXF versions are 9, 12, and 14.<br><p>

The <b>shapefile</b> export includes stations, shots, and drawing. All the drawing objects are converted to linestring.
The attribute tables contain the object data (eg, point type, orientation, etc.).
The files comprising a shapefile export are compressed in a zip archive.
<br><p>

A few export settings, specific to the selected format, can be overridden in the export dialog.<br><p>

<b>Overview export</b><br>
Sketches can be exported also from the "Overview Window" in the following formats
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i> ".th2" file</li>
<li>2D DXF (<i>LibreCAD</i>)</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>shapefile (<i>QGIS</i>)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>".xvi" file (<i>xtherion</i>)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The export of the <u>overview window</u> includes all the sketches of the current view (either plan or profile).<br>
If there are "section" points, the x-sections are also included.
