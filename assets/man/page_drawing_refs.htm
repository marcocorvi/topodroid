<h4>SKETCH REFERENCES</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Reference</i> button of the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

The column contains the sketch references,
<ul>
<li><b>legs</b>, survey midline (white)</li>
<li><b>splays</b> (grey)</li>
<li><b>latest</b> splays [G]</li>
<li><b>stations</b> names (violet)</li>
<li><b>sketch grid</b>, metric or yard</li>
<li><b>scalebar</b>, reference scalebar and magnetic North/Upward arrow</li>
<!-- li><b>outline</b>, outline of another sketch</li -->
<li><b>fix refs</b>, allow to shift the sketch independently from the shots (be carefull!!)</li>
<li><b>current scrap</b>, whether to shift only the current scrap</li>
</ul><br><p>


The "latest" splays can be highlighted with an adjustable color (default light blue) [G].
With <i>on-demand</i> download mode, these are the splays that have been downloaded most recently.
With <i>continuous</i> mode, these are all the splays downloaded during the last highlighting interval.
<br><p>

There are three sketch grids,
<ol>
<li>a grid at 1 unit spacing (dark grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 10 units spacing (grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 100 units spacing (light grey)</li>
</ol>
<br>
The sketch grid units can be 1m, 1y, 2ft, 0.1m. The default is 1 m.<br>
TopoDroid shows only the sketch grids that are appropriate for the zoom of the sketch display.
<br><p>

The scalebar is adapted to the sketch grid units (m, y, ft, dm) and has a small arrow indicating the magnetic North/Upward direction.
If the survey declination is set the true North is indicated as a light blue line, at the declination angle to the magnetic North.
If the magnetic declination is small the North blue line is very close to the magnetic North arrow.
The legend on the scalebar has the same size as the station names.<br><p>

<b>Sketch outlines</b><br>
If there are other sketches, 
the <a href="page_scrap_outline.htm">outline</a> of another sketch can also be used as reference for sketching.<br><p>

The outline of an x-section can be displayed at the relative section point.<br>
The display of the outline is turned on and off through the edit dialog of the section points.<br>
The display of all the outlines is cleared when the sketch is closed.<br><p>

<b>Sketch shift and scale</b><br>
A further checkbox [E/G] specifies whether the reference should be held fixed when
shifting the drawing with a two-finger touch. 
This is used to adjust a sketch imported from PocketTopo to the reference
in the case it gets imported with a translation.
The sketch can be zoomed with a three-finger touch.
<br><p>

<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>

When canvas views are enabled [G], there is another column, on the right, to switch the views on and off.<br>
A drawing item is displayed if it belongs to at least a view that is ON.<br>
The <b>Base</b> (B) view is always ON. The other views are
<ul>
<li><b>Floor</b> (F)</li>
<li><b>Decoration</b> (D)</li>
<li><b>Ceiling</b> (C)</li>
<li><b>Artifacts</b> (A)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The views are denoted by an uppercase letter, B, F, D, C, and A, as indicated above.<br>
The mnemonic names carry no semantics.<br><p>
