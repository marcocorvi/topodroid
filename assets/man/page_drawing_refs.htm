<h4>SKETCH REFERENCES</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Reference</i> button of the <u>sketch window</u>.<br><p>

The column contains the sketch references,
<ul>
<li><b>legs</b>, survey midline (white)</li>
<li><b>splays</b> (grey)</li>
<li><b>latest</b> splays [G]</li>
<li><b>stations</b> names (violet)</li>
<li><b>grid</b>, metric or yard</li>
<li><b>scalebar</b>, reference scalebar and North/Upward arrow</li>
<li><b>outline</b>, outline of another sketch</li>
</ul><br><p>

The "latest" splays can be highlighted in light blue color [G].
With <i>on-demand</i> download mode, these are the splays that have been downloaded most recently.
With <i>continuous</i> mode, these are all the splays downloaded during the last highlighting interval.
<br><p>

There are three grids,
<ol>
<li>a grid at 1 unit spacing (dark grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 10 units spacing (grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 100 units spacing (light grey)</li>
</ol>
<br>
The grid units can be 1m, 1y, 2ft, 0.1m. The default is 1 m.<br>
TopoDroid shows only the grids that are appropriate for the zoom of the sketch display.
<br><p>

The scalebar is adapted to the grid units (m, y, ft, dm) and has a small arrow indicating the North/Upward direction. The legend on the scalebar has the same size as the station names.<br><p>

If there are other sketches, the outline of another sketch can be displayed (in grey) to help drawing
the sketch. Checking the box opens a new dialog to pick the sketch to display, or to clear the outline
display.<br>
The outline of an x-section can be displayed at the relative section point.
The display of the outline is turned on and off through the edit dialog of the section points.<br>
The display of all the outlines is cleared when the sketch is closed.<br><p>

<b>Sketch shift and scale</b><br>

A further checkbox [E/G] specifies whether the reference should be held fixed when
shifting the drawing with a two-finger touch. 
This is used to adjust a sketch imported from PocketTopo to the reference
in the case it gets imported with a translation.
The sketch can be zoomed with a three-finger touch.
<br><p>

<b>Canvas views</b> (levels)<br>

When canvas views are enabled [G], there is another column, on the right, to switch the views on and off.<br>
A drawing item is displayed if it belongs to at least a view that is ON.<br>
The <b>Base</b> (B) view is always ON. The other views are
<ul>
<li><b>Floor</b> (F)</li>
<li><b>Fills</b> (D)</li>
<li><b>Ceiling</b> (C)</li>
<li><b>Artifacts</b> (A)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The views are denoted by an uppercase letter, B, F, D, C, and A, as indicated above.<br><p>
