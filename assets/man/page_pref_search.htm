<h4>Setting search</h4>

The setting search dialog allows searching for a word in the descriptions of the settings.<br>
The search uses case-insensitive pattern matching.<br>
Wildcards and regular expressions are acceptable.<br><p>

The result of the search is the list of settings sections that contain a match.<br>
Tapping the name of a section in the list shows the setting window with the
settings of the section.<br><p>

The button "cancel" closes the dialog.<br><p>
