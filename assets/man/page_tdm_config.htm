The list is empty if the project has no surveys.<br>
Each survey can be selected for further actions by tapping its checkbox.

<li>Export the cave project (Therion or Survex)</li>
<li>Delete the cave project</li>

</ul>

</ul>

Surveys are added to the project by tapping their checkboxes and confirming with 
the <i>OK</i> button.<br><p>

<h2>Project 3D view</h2>
The project is displayed in the 3D viewer beginning with the first survey.<br>
The following surveys are shown in the 3D only if they are (directly or indirectly) connected to
the first survey.<br><p>

If several surveys are georeferenced, they can all be displayed in 3D, together with the
connected surveys.<br><p>

<h2>Surveys 2D plan view</h2>

The plan-view of the surveys allows defining "equates" graphically.
<br><p> 

This window displays surveys in plan view, with midline and station names.
<br>
Each survey has a different color. After a while the colors repeat; therefore, you should display
only two or three surveys at a time.
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.
The size of the station names is equal to that in the <u>Drawing window</u>.
<br>
The view can be panned and zoomed.
A survey can be grabbed (tap on a station: it gets circled) and dragged around while the other surveys do not move.
In this way you can overlap stations of different surveys that you want to equate.
When they overlap, circle them both by tapping the point: you can then insert the equate between them with the "add equate" button.

<h3>Buttons</h3>
It has four buttons:<br>
<ul>
<li>
    <i>Add equate</i>: opens a dialog where the user can set which stations are to be equated. 
    In order to manually add an equate between surveys of the cave project, tap the "OK" button".
</li>
<li><i>List equates</i> between surveys of the cave project.</li>
<li><i>Reduce the number of displayed stations</i></li>
<li><i>Increase the number of displayed stations</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>Equates</h3>
On the dialog presented when clicking on the <i>List equates</i> button, you can drop an equate by tapping its entry in the dialog listing.<br><p>
