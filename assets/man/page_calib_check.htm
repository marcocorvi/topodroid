<h4>CALIBRATION-CHECK SHOTS</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Calib. check</u> menu in the <i>Survey</i> window.<br><p>

The dialog shows the calibration check legs.
Tapping on a leg-shot it displays the distribution of the angle differences between the shots of the leg and the
average leg direction.<br><p>

If there is the opposite leg, the distribution of the angles between any two shots, one for each leg,
is displayed on the right in light gray color.<br>
The yellow line is 0.5&deg; and the red line is 1.0&deg;<br><p>

If there are two other calibration check shots that make a triangle with the selected one, the distribution of the
misclosure errors is shown on the right in gray color.<br>
The misclosure error is computed (approximately) as the ratio between the misclosure distance and the radius of the circle enclosing the triangle.<br>
The yellow line is 0.5 prercent and the red line is 1.0 prercent.<br><p>
