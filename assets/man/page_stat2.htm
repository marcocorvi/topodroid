<h4>SKETCH STATISTICS</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Statistics</i> menu of the <u>sketch window</u> (plan or profile view).
It displays both data statistics and sketch data statistics.<br><p>


The survey statistics are
<ul>
<li>number of (regular) legs, sketch legs, their total, profile, and plan lengths</li>
<li>number of duplicate legs, sketch duplicate legs, and their total length</li>
<li>number of surface leg, sketch surface legs, and their total length</li>
<li>number of splay shots, and sketch splay shots</li>
<li>number of stations, and sketch stations</li>
<li>number of shots not attached to the sketch if any, and their total length. Tapping this line opens the dialog
with the list of unattached shots.</li>
<li>number of cycles (including the backshot-cycles) if any.</li>
<li>number of disconnected survey components if greater than 1.
(This is 1 if the legs are all attached together in one survey)</li>
</ul>

Other sketch related statistics are
<ul>
<li>origin station (zero station)</li>
<li>the midline length</li>
<li>profile-view (3D) midline length</li>
<li>plan-view midline length</li>
<li>the sketch extension (West, East, North and South)</li>
<li>the sketch depths, both positive (above the zero station) and negative (below the zero station)</li>
<li>average angle error between shots of the same leg [degrees]</li>
<li>the number of loops, those used in closure compensation and those not used</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

For each loop:
<ul>
<li>closing shot</li>
<li>number of loop shots</li>
<li>closing error: 3d length over total loop length</li>
<li>horizontal and vertical error lengths</li>
<li>percent error: ratio between error and loop length</li>
<li>estimated shot angle error [degrees]. This is the error times the square root of the number of shots and divided by the length.
The result, in radians, is converted to degrees. </li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Length are in the units set in the app settings.<br><p>

Tapping on the loop closure entry switches the text between the closure error, and the list of loop stations.<br><p>
