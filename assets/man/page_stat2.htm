<h4>Sketch statistics</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Statistics</u> menu of the <i>Sketch</i> window (plan or profile view).<br><p>


The survey statistics are
<ul>
<li>number of (regular) legs, their total, profile, and plan lengths</li>
<li>number of duplicate legs, and their total length</li>
<li>number of surface leg, and their total length</li>
<li>number of splay shots</li>
<li>number of stations</li>
<li>number of cycles (including the backshot-cycles)</li>
<li>number of disconnected surveys (this is 1 if the legs are all attached together in one survey)</li>
</ul>

The sketch related statistics are
<ul>
<li>origin station (zero station)</li>
<li>the survey length</li>
<li>3D length</li>
<li>length of the plan-projection</li>
<li>the survey extension (West, East, North and South)</li>
<li>the survey depths, both positive (above the zero station) and negative (below the zero station)</li>
<li>the  number of stations</li>
<li>the number of shots (regular, duplicate, and surface)</li>
<li>the number of splays</li>
<li>average angle error between shots of the same leg [degrees]</li>
<li>the number of loops</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

For each loop:
<ul>
<li>closing shot</li>
<li>closing error: 3d length over total loop length</li>
<li>horizontal and vertical error lengths</li>
<li>parcent error: ratio between error and loop length</li>
<li>average angular error [degrres]</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<b>Note</b>: length are in the units set in the app settings.<br><p>
