<h4>SKETCH STATISTICS</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Stats</i> menu of the <u>Drawing window</u> (plan or profile view).
It displays both data-reduction statistics and sketch related statistics.<br><p>

The data-reduction statistics are
<ul>
<li><i>Legs</i>: number of (regular) legs, sketch-leg total length, profile and plan view cave-leg total lengths.</li>
<li><i>Duplicate shots</i>: number of duplicate legs and their total length.</li>
<li><i>Surface shots</i>: number of surface leg and their total length.</li>
<li><i>Splays</i>: number of splay shots, and sketch splay shots.</li>
<li><i>Stations</i>: number of stations, and sketch stations.</li>
<li><i>Leg sigma</i>: average position error between repeated shots.</li>
<li><i>Survey length</i>: length of legs not including flagged or repeated legs.</li>
<li>
  <i>Dangling shots</i>: number of shots not attached to the sketch if any, and their total length.
  Tapping this line opens the dialog with the list of unattached shots.</li>
<li>
  <i>Cycles</i>: number of cycles (including the backshot-cycles) if any.
  This item is only shown if there is at least one loop defined.
</li>
<li>
  <i>Components</i>: number of disconnected survey components if greater than 1.
  This is 1 if the legs are all attached together in one survey.
</li>
<li><i>Sketch origin station</i>: sketch origin (zero station).</li>
<li><i>Sketch length</i>: the midline length.</li>
<li><i>3D length</i>: profile-view (3D) midline length.</li>
<li><i>Plan length</i>: plan-view midline length.</li>
<li><i>W E N S</i>: the sketch extension (West, East, North and South).</li>
<li><i>Sketch denivelation</i>: the sketch denivelations, both positive and negative, relative to the sketch center (the sketch origin unless re-centered).</li>
<li><i>Cave denivelation</i>: the cave denivelation relative to the sketch origin.</li>
<li><i>Angle errors</i>: average angle error between shots of the same leg [degrees].</li>
<li>the number of loops, those used in closure compensation and those not used</li>
</ul>

<p>
When there are two values separated by a number sign (#), the first value is the total survey value,
and the second is the data reduction value, i.e., the value for the connected component that contains
the reference station of sketch.
These two values are different when the survey midline data contains more than one connected component.
</p>

For each loop:
<ul>
<li>closing shot</li>
<li>number of loop shots</li>
<li>closing error: 3d length over total loop length</li>
<li>horizontal and vertical error lengths</li>
<li>percent error: ratio between error and loop length</li>
<li>estimated shot angle error [degrees]. This is the error times the square root of the number of shots and divided by the length.
The result, in radians, is converted to degrees. </li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Tapping on the loop closure entry switches the text between the closure error, and the list of loop stations.<br><p> 

Length are in the units set in the app settings.<br><p>

<b>Denivelations</b><br>
The sketch center is the sketch origin, unless the sketch is re-centered.<br><p>
The cave denivelation includes the survey data that are not "surface", "duplicate", or "commented".
It includes the splays, therefore if you have taken "surface" splays you need to mark them as "surface".<br><p>
