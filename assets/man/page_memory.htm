<h4>DistoX memory</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Memory</u> button of the <i>Device</i> window.<br><p>

<b>Memory dump<b><br><p>

The <i>Dump</i> button reads the content of the DistoX memory.
Reading the DistoX memory directly is a slow process, and the DistoX must be kept "ON" while doing it.
It is advisable to read a portion of memory, say 50 entries, at a time:
enter the initial and final memory location in the two text fields to its right.
If you have entered a filename it is also saved to a dump file (in the "dump" folder).<br><p>

Memory inspection requires some knowledge of the internals of the DistoX: at a minimum the address space, and the way data are stored. You should have read the DistoX documentation before using it.<br><p>

The result of the memory dump is shown in a list at the bottom of the dialog.
Each line contains 
<ul>
<li>the memory location</li>
<li>a letter-code telling whether it is a shot ('d') or a calibration ('g') data</li>
<li>the values of the memory.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Entries without values are marked with a question-mark ('?') code.<br>
Shot values are shown as length (meters), azimuth and clino (degrees).<br>
The "accuracy" data of the DistoX2 are not shown.<br>
For the calibration data, the raw values are shown ('m' data are not shown for the DistoX2).<br><p>


<b>Only for DistoX A3<b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Read</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Store</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Reset</b> a portion of memory, ie, marks it "to-be-downloaded"</li>
</ul>
