<h4>DistoX MEMORY</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Memory</i> button of the <u>device window</u>.<br><p>

<b>Memory dump</b><br><p>

The <i>Dump</i> button reads the content of the DistoX memory.
Reading the DistoX memory directly is a slow process, and the DistoX must be kept "ON" while doing it.
It is advisable to read a small portion of memory, say 20 entries, at a time:
enter the initial and final data memory index in the two text fields to the right.
Data are read from the initial index up to one before the final index.
For the DistoX2 the memory indices range from 0 included to 1064 excluded.<br>
For the DistoX version 1 the memory they range from 0 included to 4096 excluded.<br>
<p>

If you have entered a filename the memory dump is also saved to a file (in the "dump" folder).<br><p>

The result of the memory dump is shown in a list at the bottom of the dialog.
Each line contains 
<ul>
<li>the memory location</li>
<li>a letter-code: foresight shot ('d'), backsight ('b'), calibration data ('g' or 'm')</li>
<li>the values of the memory.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Uppercase letter code denotes data that have not been downloaded yet.<br>
Shot are shown as length (meters), azimuth and clino (degrees).<br>
The "accuracy" data of the DistoX2 are not shown.<br>
For the calibration data, the raw values are shown. The 'm' data are not shown for the DistoX2.<br>
Entries without a recognized type are marked with a question-mark ('?') code.<br><p>

<!-- anything special to XBLE ? -->


<b>Only for DistoX A3</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Read</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Store</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Reset</b> a portion of memory, ie, marks it "to-be-downloaded"</li>
</ul>
