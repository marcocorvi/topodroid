<h4>SKETCH POINT</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point symbol and tap the
<i>Edit</i> button in the <u>Drawing window</u> (in "edit" mode).<br><p>

Point properties:
<ul>
<li><b>size</b> (XS, S, M, L, XL)</li>
<li><b>orientation</b>, if the point is orientable</li>
<li><b>layers</b>, the canvas views on which the point is displayed [T]</li>
<li><b>text</b>, if the point has text associated</li>
<li>additional Therion <b>options</b></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The canvas views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code. You can change the views the point belongs to.
The point icon is not displayed if all its views are OFF.
The selectable point will nevertheless be shown in edit mode, so that the point edit dialog remains accessible.
<br><p>

<b>Cancel</b> closes the dialog.<br>

<b>Save</b> confirms the changes and closes the dialog.<br><p>

With <i>side-drag</i> enabled, the point orientation can be changed also by sliding down from the upper left and right corners of the canvas (which turns the point anti-clockwise and clockwise, respectively).<br><p>

The <i>BACK</i> key closes the dialog without saving the changes.<br><p>
