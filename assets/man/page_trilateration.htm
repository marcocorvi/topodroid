<h4>TRILATERATION</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
Trilateration is a special "loop compensation" applied to triangles.
It can be used in short surveys in non-uniform magnetic environment
as the azimuths are computed by measuring the sides of triangles, relying on the fact that
the angles of a triangle are determined by its sides.
The values measured by the device are used for the inclinations.
<br><p>

Trilateration is enabled by setting the <i>Loop compensation</i> to "Trilateration".<br><p>

The survey should be made of a net (or a ladder) of triangles. Therefore you measure 0-1, 1-2, and 0-2;
then 2-3 and 1-3, and so on.<br><p>

The trilateration algorithm carries out a global estimate for the angle azimuths, and is rather slow.
Therefore it is advisable not to use it for large surveys.
