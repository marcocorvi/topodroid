<h4>SKETCH SHOT</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a survey shot and tap the <u>Item</u> button in the <u>Drawing window</u> (in "edit" mode).
<br><p>

Shot properties:
<ul>
<li>length, azimuth, and inclination.
If the shot has a <b>mark</b> this is shown with symbols as in the <a href="page_shot_edit1.htm">shot edit dialog</a>:
(*) feature, (&#8741;) ridge, (v) backsight, and (o) generic mark.</li>
<li><b>stations</b></li>
<li><b>shot type</b> (D forward, B backward, M manual).</li>
<li><b>comment</b></li>
<li>profile <b>extend</b>: "left" (-1), "vertical" (0), or "right" (+1)</li>
<li>profile <b>fractional extend</b> slider (extended profile view legs only) [T]</li>
<li><img src="btn_duplicate.png"  width="36" border="1"> "duplicate" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_surface.png"  width="36" border="1"> "surface" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_comment.png"  width="36" border="1"> "commented" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_backsight.png"  width="36" border="1"> "backshot" flag</li>
<li>checkboxes to <b>hide</b> the midline (legs only)</li>
<li>color, if enabled (splay only)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>


The <b>shot type</b> is orange if the leg is inconsistent with the siblings,
and red if there is a possible magnetic problems.
<br><p>

<b>Save</b> confirms the changes and closes the dialog.<br>
There is a warning if, upon editing a leg shot, it differs from another leg between the same stations more than one fourth in length, or 15&deg;.<br><p>

<b>Cancel</b> and the <u>Back</u> key close the dialog without saving the changes.<br><p>

<b>Midline hiding</b><br>
Leg shots have checkboxes to hide the display of the midline on the side of either stations.
The hiding stations are displayed either red or violet in the drawing. The hiding is reverted through the edit dialog of the station.<br><p>

<b>Leg extend</b> [E]<br>
In the extended profile legs are usually drawn either to the left, or vertical, or to the right (or not drawn at all).
The choice among these options is the "extend" value, that specifies whether the leg is extended left (-1), vertically (0), or right (+1).
When a leg is selected in the extended profile view a horizontal bar is drawn through its middle point.
by swiping from the midpoint along the bar the user can quickly change the "extend" of the leg.
<br><p>

<b>Shot fractional extend</b> [T]<br>
It is also possible to set a "fractional extend": a value between -1.5 and 1.5, instead of only the integer values -1 (left), 0 (vertical), and
1 (right).
By default the "extend" has an integer value and the fractional part is zero.
The slider below the "extend" checkboxes changes the integer part and the fractional part of the shot "extend".<br><p>

The fractional part of the shot "extend" is set to zero when
<ul>
<li>the shot extend is set with a multi-shot action (except for the "flip" action)</li>
<li>the shot extend is changed in the <u>Drawing window</u> using the yellow extend line</li>
<li>the shot extend is changed in the shot edit dialog (of the <u>Survey Data window</u>)</li>
<li>the shot extend is assigned by TopoDroid</li>
</ul><br><p>

To set a fractional extend you must enable the relative setting.
As most map-drawing programs do not support fractional "extend", this setting is disabled by default.
<br><p>

<b>Splay custom color</b> [T]<br>
It is possible to assign a custom color to each splay shot. The color is stored in the database and is thus shared among the sketches.<br>
Splay coloring is determined by a setting [G]: either disabled, or selectable with a color picker, or among a color palette.<br>
The color dialog has also a button to clear the splay custom color.
