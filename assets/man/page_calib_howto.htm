<h4>DistoX HOW TO CALIBRATE</h4>

The DistoX needs to be calibrated before using. The calibration is a transformation of the data that accounts for
the non-perfect orthogonality of the axis of the sensors, their misalignment with the laser direction,
and effects of the electronics on the magnetic field.<br><p>

To compute the coefficients of this transformation, you must take a number of "accurate" calibration data
recording the raw readings of the sensors. This occurs when the DistoX is in "calibration mode".<br><p>

The calibration data must be taken in a place free from magnetic influences, eg, in a cave or in a wood.
Beware of metal objects and electronic objects that might affect the DistoX.<br><p>

The data must cover all directions and for each direction you must take a group of four data at different rotation about the laser axis.<br> 
The best way is to take 14 groups of four data each, eight groups in the directions of the corners of a cube, and six in those of the centers of the faces. The four data in each group should be taken rotating the DistoX by 90&deg; between one and the next. You can take more than 14 groups of data; the more the better.<br>
At a minimum you must take four groups of four data (with different roll) in four directions at 90&deg; in the horizontal plane,
as if these directions were going from the center of a cube towards the center of four side-faces.
The other 40 data do not have to be taken very carefully if the <i>PocketTopo</i> group policy is used, because they are treated as individual data.
You can take more individyual calibration data.<br><p>

The calibration data that will form a group must be taken with care. Inaccurate group data will result in a bad calibration.
Therefore use fixed points (eg, a point in the wall, or on a tree) and far apart (a few meters) so that the accuracy of pointing the laser is better than the wanted calibration accuracy (2 cm at 5 m are about 0.2&deg;).<br><p>

After you have taken the calibration data, download them with TopoDroid. You do not need to wait to take all the calibration
data to download them: when you download some data these are added to those already in the calibration.
Therefore if, by mistake you take five data instead of four, download the data and delete one of them in TopoDroid.<br><p>

Before computing the calibration you must tell TopoDroid how the calibration data are divided in groups, i.e., how groups are assigned to data.
The groups are denoted with positive numbers. A data with group number zero or no group, is not used to compute the calibration.
Deleted data have group -1 and are usually not shown in the list.<br><p>

TopoDroid implements two policies to assign groups automatically:
<ul>
<li><i>TopoDroid</i>: all data divided in groups of four data. This is the default policy</li>
<li><i>PocketTopo</i>: four groups of four data, followed by individual data</li>
<!-- li>"data group assignment based on the angle discrepancy between data</li -->
</ul>
<br>
The group numbers can be assigned or changed by editing the calibration data. Tap on a data entry in the list to open the data editing dialog.
<br>

When the groups are defined, you can compute the calibration.
Besides the calibration coefficients, the dialog shows the average error (and the "delta" of the original algorithm),
the standard deviation of the error, and the maximal error.
Furthermore there is a histogram with the distribution of errors for the calibration data. This plot has two vertical lines:
a yellow mark at 0.5&deg; and a red one at 1.0&deg;<br><p>

To summarize, to calibrate the DistoX you need to:
<ul>
<li>turn the DistoX in calibration mode</li>
<li>take the data of the calibration data</li>
<li>download the data to the app</li>
<li>assign the groups to the data (automatically or manually)</li>
<li>compute the calibration coefficients</li>
<li>upload the coefficients to the DistoX</li>
<li>revert the DistoX to normal mode</li>
</ul>
