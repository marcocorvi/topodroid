<h4>GNSS GEO-POINT</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>GNSS</i> button of the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Geo-points</a> window.<br><p>
  
To use the GNSS the Android "Location" service must be enabled.
For security reasons a generic app, like TopoDroid, cannot enable the GNSS.
If it is not enabled, TopoDroid shows a dialog asking whether you want do enable it (through the "Settings" app).
Remember to disable it when you are done, to save battery life.
