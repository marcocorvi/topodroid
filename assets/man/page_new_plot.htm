<h3>NEW SKETCH</h3>

This dialog is opened from the <i>New sketch</i> button in the <i>Sketch list</i> dialog.<br><p>

It has two text field and a confirmation button.
<ul>
<li><b>name</b> is the name assigned to the sketch.</li>
<li><b>reference station</b></li>
<!-- li><b>landscape</b> mode [T] [default no]</li -->
<li><b>projected</b> profile checkbox (by default the profile is "extended") [E]</li>
<li><b>projection azimuth</b>, for projected profile view [E]</li>
<li><b>dangling</b> sketch (origin not attached to midline)</li>
</ul><br><p>

You can use either the <b>name</b> suggested by TopoDroid
(an increasing integer number) or enter a mnemonic name. Each sketch is saved with two files, one for the plan,
the other for the profile. The filenames are obtained composing the survey name, the sketch name, and a suffix 
("p" for plan, "s" for profile). For example the sketch "2" of the survey "cave" is saved in the two files
"cave-2p.tdr" and "cave-2s.tdr".<br><p>

TopoDroid will give a warning if the name coincides with the name of an existing sketch.
In particular it is not possible to have two sketches with names differing only by the characters case
since the two sketches would have the same file because the filesystem is case insensitive.<br><p>

<b>WARNING</b>.
The name of the sketch cannot contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.
Slashes are replaced with dashes '-'.<br><p>

<b>Reference station</b><br>
The reference station (origin) defines how the sketch is translated with respect to the survey midline.
The survey midline defines the sketch scale (the drawing is scaled at 40 canvas units per meter) and rotation, but leaves undefined
how the drawing is translated with respect to the midline. This uncertainty is resolved by specifying the
reference station to be at (0,0) in the reference frame of the sketch canvas.<br><p>

The reference station also determines the survey midline <b>data reduction</b> for the sketch.
From the sketch point of view the midline is built starting from the reference station and continuing
as long as data can be attached. The resulting midline
forms a tree, rooted at the reference station. In order to make the canvas less cluttered, 
is possible to hide the display of portion of the midline, either
after a station, or before it (i.e., between the reference station and the station).
This is explained in the "Sketch station" dialog.<br><p>

If the survey has "fixed station origin" [setting], TopoDroid prefills the "reference station" with the first survey station.
Otherwise it uses the last station or the active station if this is set.
You can change it if you want another station as sketch reference.<br><p>

The app signals an error if the reference station does not exist in the survey data.
It can be forced to use an non-existing station by checking the "dangling" checkbox.<br>
In this case the sketch will not have a midline reference, neither splays nor stations,
until the reference station is assigned to a leg.<br><p>

If the <b>projected</b> checkbox is checked the sketch profile is projected,
The direction of view, ie, the projection azimuth, is chosen with a graphical dialog that allows to rotate the
survey midline around a vertical axis.<br><p>
Otherwise the sketch profile is extended and the  <b>projection azimuth</b> is not shown.<br><p>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In <b>landscape</b> mode the North and the vertical are towards the left side of the screen, in plan and profile views, respectively.
Likewise, the x-sections have the vertical to the left side.
