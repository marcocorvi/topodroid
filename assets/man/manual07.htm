<h3>[7] SHOT LIST</h3>

The shots are shown in a list. The list has no header to save space.  The shot information are
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>Index (optional: it is shown only if the relative choice in the <i>display mode</i> dialog is checked)</li>
<li>From station</li>
<li>To station</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Azimuth</li>
<li>Inclination</li>
<li>Extend direction: either left (&lt;), right (&gt;), vertical (|), or ignore (a blank space). The "extend" of splays is present only if explicitly set by the user in one of the shot edit dialogs.</li>
</ul>
There can be additional characters for the splay flags, the shot flag, and the presence of a photo (#). Finally the beginning of the comment if any.<br>
The shot flag can be: duplicate shot (&#x00b2;), surface shot (&#x00f7;), only-profile (&#x00a7;), only-plan (_), and backshot (&#x266d;).<br><p>

The splay marks are distinguished by the closing bracket: 
no mark (plain square bracket) feature (with a upper tick, &#x2990;), ridge (slight curved, &#x2773;),
backsight (undeerlined, &#x298c;), and generic (with a lower tick, &#x298e;).<br><p>

By default the <i>index</i> is the index of the shot in the survey. There is a setting to use the <i>BRIC</i> shot-index instead.
The shot survey-index is guaranteed to be unique. The BRIC index is not unique because the BRIC memory can be reset.<br><p>

Blank shots, and repeated-legs can be hidden. Splay shots can also be hidden to unclutter the list of shots. However, even if splays are not shown, you can see those at a station by tapping on the station name in a leg shot. To hide them tap again on the station name (even a tap on the name in a splay will do).<br><p>

TopoDroid can set the station names automatically according to the <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station assignment policy</a>.<br><p>

<b>Shot item taps</b>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>a tap on a station name puts it in <i>editing-mode</i>, and the station is underlined.
If inline station editing is enabled the station name can be edited.
The station name edit must be finished with the ENTER key to take effect.</li>
<li>when the station is underlined, a couple of tap toggles the display of splays at that station (only if splays are globally hidden).</li>
<li>a tap on the shot data opens the <a href="page_shot_edit1.htm">shot edit</a> dialog, in which you can set the stations as well as other attributes of the shot.</li>
<li>a long tap on a station name makes it the <a href="page_current.htm">active</a> station (it is highlighted green)</li>
<li>a long tap on a shot starts the multi-shot selection</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

If you use TopoDroid automatic <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station naming</a>, you are likely to need the shot dialog only to enter the comment, and to change the "extend" direction. These two actions can be done also from the <u>Drawing window</u>, by selecting the shot in "edit" mode [A] and picking the <i>Note</i> button. The extend can be changed also graphically on the sketch. These actions are described in the section on the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

<b>Multi-shot selection</b><br>
The selected shots have a gray background (possibly only in the back of the stations).
Tapping a shot adds/removes it from the selection.
Subsequent long-taps either select or de-select all entries from the previously selected or de-selected shot to the current one.<br>
In multiselection, the last tapped shot stations are highlighted in light yellow.<br> 

The number of shots in the selection is displayed in the title bar within angle brackets.<br>

The button bar changes to the buttons for the multi-shot actions:
<ul>
<li><img src="btn_ignore.png"   width="36" border="1"> clear the shots extend</li>
<li><img src="btn_left.png"     width="36" border="1"> set the shots extend to <i>left</i></li>
<li><img src="btn_multishot_flip_extend.png"     width="36" border="1"> flip the shots extend</li>
<li><img src="btn_right.png"  width="36" border="1"> set the shots extend to <i>right</i></li>
<li><img src="btn_multishot_special_actions.png" width="36" border="1"> special actions dialog [T]</li>
<li><img src="btn_delete.png" width="36" border="1"> delete the shots and put them in the shot-buffer. Warning: hidden secondary-leg shots are deleted when the corresponding leg shot is deleted</li>
<li><img src="btn_copy.png"   width="36" border="1"> copy the shots to the shot-buffer</li>
<li><img src="btn_clear.png"  width="36" border="1"> close the multi-shot selection</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The special actions dialog includes [T]:
<ul>
<li>renumber the selected shots</li>
<li>swap the stations of each shot</li>
<li>set the sketch color of the selected splay shots</li>
<li>mark the splays as X-splay or H/V-splay (or make them normal)</li>
<li>compute the strike and dip of the plane containing the shots (only if the <u>Plane interpolation</u> option is enabled)</li>
</ul>

The stations of the first shot are used to seed the renumbering. They can be changed in the dialog.
If both stations are entered, the first selected shot is a leg and the following selected shots are renumbered consistently.
If only the FROM station is entered (and the TO station is left empty), all the shots are renumbered as splay.
<br><p>

<div style="font-size:90%">
Setting the color of splays is enabled if only splays have been selected, otherwise it is disabled.<br>
The computation of strike and dip of the bedding plane requires that all the selected shots have the same FROM station. Otherwise, it is disabled.
The result is shown in the dialog and added to (replaced if already present) the comment of the first selected shot.
