<h4>TopoDroid ECOSYSTEM</h4>

When working with TopoDroid, you might find useful some complementary and auxiliary apps:
<ul>
<li><i>Cave3D</i> is a 3D viewer for Therion files, and is used by TopoDroid for the 3D display</li>
<li><i>Proj4</i> is a (very simple) coordinate converter app, used by TopoDroid to convert long-lat values to other coordinate systems</li>
<li><i>ThManager</i> is a manager to put together surveys, exported in Therion format, in a cave project, ie, a thconfig file</li>
<li><i>MobileTopographer</i> is a geolocation app. You can use it to take the point coordinates and have TopoDroid read them from the point file in MobileTopographer pointlist.</li>
<li><i>GPS-Impetus</i> is another geolocation app, that can be used to take coordinates and copied to TopoDroid fixed-point dialog.</li>
<li>an app to take pictures (usually there is a <i>Camera</i> app)</li>
<li>a File Manager (eg. <i>MiXplorer</i>) is definitely useful to look at the files (and to make backup copies)</li>
<li><i>SQLiteViewer</i> (or any other SQLite manager app) can be helpful to inspect the TopoDroid databases</li>
</ul><br><p>

In addition, depending how you process your surveys, you may want to install
<ul>
<li>a image viewer/editor (usually there is a preinstalled image viewer, <i>Gallery</i>)</li>
<li>a DXF viewer/editor (eg. <i>TurboViewer</i>)</li>
<li>a spreadsheet viewer/editor (eg. Google <i>Sheets</i>)</li>
<li>a SVG viewer (eg. <i>SVG viewer</i>)</li>
<li>a ZIP archiver (eg. <i>ZArchiver</i>)</li>
<li><i>GoogleEarth</i></li>
<li><i>AndroWish</i> if you want to execute xtherion</li>
<li>a track file viewer (eg, <i>Androzic</i>)</li>
</ul><br><p>

Finally a <i>wakeup-touch</i> app turns out to be very convenient during the survey session in the cave. In order to save battery you may want to set the display sleep timeout very short (eg, half a minute). With a wakeup-touch app you do not have to press the power button to wake up your android, but just need to touch the proximity sensor. I use to keep my device in a protective box opening only the cover lid. The power button on the side is therefore not accessible when the device is in the box, and the wakeup-touch app is really handy.<br><p>
