<h4>Project Plan View</h4>

The <u>Project Plan View window</u> is presented when you tap the <i>Plan</i> button in the <u>Projetc Manager</u> window.<br>

It displays selected surveys of the cave project on the horizontal plane (thus in plan view).
<br><p>

The display can be panned and zoomed in/out.<br>
By selecting a station of one survey (tapping on its name) that survey can be
dragged around while keeping the others fixed.<br><p>

By this means the station can be brought close to a station of another survey.<br>
The two stations can be selected at the same time with a tap nearby, and an
"equate" between the two stations added to the cave project.<br><p>

When two stations are "equated", they are joined by a dotted line in the plan view.<br><p>

Equates can be also added manually through the <a href="page_tdm_equate_new.htm">Equate Dialog</a>.
The list of equates is shown with the <a href="page_tdm_equates.htm">Equates Dialog</a>,
through which they can be removed from the cave project.<br><p>

<b>Menus</b><br>

<li>Display <i>fewer</i> station names</li>
<li>Display <i>more</i> station names</li>
