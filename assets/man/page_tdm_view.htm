<h4>PROJECT MANAGER - Plan View</h4>

The <u>Project Plan View window</u> is shown when you tap the <i>Plan</i> button in the <u>Project Manager</u> window.<br>

It displays the surveys of the cave project that have been selected, on the horizontal plane (thus in plan view), with midline and station names.
<br><p>

<p>The midlines are displayed with the color of the respective survey.<br>
The display can be panned and zoomed in/out.
</p>

By selecting a station of one survey (tapping on its name) that survey can be dragged around while keeping the others fixed.<br>
By this means the station can be brought close to a station of another survey.<br>
When they are close, the two stations can be selected at the same time with a tap nearby, and "equated" in the cave project, ie, the two surveys are connected at the "equated" stations.<br><p>
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.

The size of the station names is equal to that in the <u>Drawing window</u>.<p>

Equates can be also added manually through the <a href="page_tdm_equate_new.htm">Equate Dialog</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Possible equates</h2>
With the "possible equates" button the set of stations in different surveys, with coincident name are displayed
with yellow dashed lines joining the stations with same name.<br>
Tapping on a station of a yellow line, the corresponding possible equates are added to the project.<br>
The display of the possible equates is cleared by tapping on the "possible equates" button a second time.<br><p>

<b>Warning</b>
There is no check that by adding equates the project graph acquires loops.<br><p>


<h2>Equates list</h2>

The <a href="page_tdm_equates.htm">Equates</a> dialog is presented when clicking on the <i>List equates</i> button.
You can drop an equate by tapping its entry in the listing.<br><p>
