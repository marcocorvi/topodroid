<h4>DistoX DEVICE SELECT</h4>

TopoDroid can work with more than one DistoX at once.
To this extent you must set the "data download mode" to "multi" and have more than one DistoX paired with your Android.
In this case when you tap the Download button you get a dialog to choose from which DistoX to download the data.
