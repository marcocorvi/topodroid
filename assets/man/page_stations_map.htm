<h4>STATION NAMES MAP</h4>

This dialog is opened from the "STATIONS" menu of the survey window.<br>
The dialog is used to replace the station names of the survey.<br><p>

The dialog contains a two-column list of station names. The left column contains the current names.
The right column is for the replacement names.

Buttons:
<ul>
<li>OK: to confirm the replacement</li>
<li>Cancel: to abort the replacement</li>
<li>Import: to read the replacement named from a file.</li>
</ul>

If two stations are mapped to the same name, there is an alert before the name replacement.
The user can cancel the replacement and fix the name conflict or decide to continue with the replacement.<br><p>

<b>Input file</b><br>
The input file must be a text file with a pair of names (old and new station names) separated by a single space on each line.<br>
If the first name of a pair is not a station of the survey the pair is not taken into account.
If the first name is a survey station, the second name is set as its replacement.<br><p>
