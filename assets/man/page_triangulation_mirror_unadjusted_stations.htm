    <h1>Unadjusted stations</h1>

    <p>
      Shows the stations that were previously adjusted and got unadjusted because of the current mirroring/unmirroring operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This usually is caused by the new position of the mirrored/unmirrored station that makes impossible to solve triangles for other stations that were previously adjusted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choose if you want to go on with the mirroring/unmirroring action clicking on the <i>Ok</i> button or cancel it clicking on the <i>Cancel</i> button.
