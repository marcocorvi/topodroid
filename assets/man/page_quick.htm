<h3>TopoDroid QUICK GUIDE</h3>

This page covers the basics of TopoDroid. Refer to the user manual for more details.<br><p>

<b>[1] Pair the device with Android</b><br>
The device must be paired with the Android. This should be done also for bluetooth Low-Energy devices (Sap5, Bric4).
Do that with the "Settings" app. Go to "network | bluetooth", turn the device on, and scan for devices. Your device should be found. Select it and enter the PIN "0000" (four zeros) to pair it with Android if asked to.
If your device repeatedly asks the pin, set the socket to "insecure" in TopoDroid settings.<br><p>
