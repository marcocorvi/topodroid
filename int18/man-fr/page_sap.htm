<h4>Sap5</h4>


The Sap5, Shetland Attack Pony, has a single button.
It is turned on and off by tapping two times in a row quickly on the button.
<br><p>

The Sap5 needs to be paired with the Android before it can be used in TopoDroid.
Open your Android' <i>Settings</i> app, and go to "Connected Devices". If the Sap5 is not listed,
turn it on and select "Pair a new device". The Sap5 should appear in the list of available devices.
Tap on it and enter the PIN "000000", six zeros.<br><p>

When the Sap5 is switched on, the laser is on. To take a shot point is on the target and "press and hold"
the button, until the laser light has a glitch, or turns off. The readings are shown on the screen, either
one at a time (azimuth, clino, distance, and plane extension) or all three at once. You cycle through the displays by tilting
back and for the device. If you press the button when a value is on the display the laser turns on and
the device is ready to take the next shot.<br><p>

After the display of the readings, the screen shows the menus:
<ul>
<li><i>Store</i>, to assign stations to the shot and save it in the internal memory</li>
<li><i>Discard</i> goes back to take another shot</li>
<li><i>Main menu</i>, with
  <ul>
  <li>the device <i>Settings</i></li>
  <li><i>Measure</i> goes back to take a measurement</li>
  <li><i>Calibrate</i> enters the device calibration procedure</li>
  <li><i>Visualize</i> a rough survey plan view</li>
  <li><i>Info</i> displays (among others) info on the shot, the device hw/fw, the battery charge,
    and sensor readings in real-time</li>
  <li><i>Off</i> turns off the Sap5</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

The battery level is shown on screen.
The Sap5 has a micro USB socket on the back. When it is connected to the PC it charges and the data
can be downloaded using the "PonyTrainer" program.<br><p>

When it is connected to TopoDroid, each shot is automatically transferred to the app as soon as it 
is taken. If the connection is interrupted, the shots taken when not connected are <i>not</i> transferred
when the connection is re-established. Therefore the Sap5 is suitable for surveys in which it can
always remain in connection with the Android.<br><p>

Refer to the Sap5 documentation for further details about the device.<br><p>
