<h4>GEO-POINT EDIT</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping a fixed point entry in the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Geo-points list</a> window.<br><p>

The dialog shows
<ul>
<li>longitude, latitude and geoid altitude. WGS84 ellipsoid altitude in square brackets</li>
<li>point <b>name</b> and <b>comment</b></li>
<li>magnetic <b>declination</b> at the point (at the current date)</li>
</ul><br><p>

Buttons
<ul>
<li><b>View</b> the point in a Location app (provided you have one installed)</li>
<li><b>Clear</b> converted coordinates. This action is immediate.</li>
<li><b>Convert</b> the geo-point coordinates to another reference system (using the app Proj4)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the geo-point record</li>
</ul>

If the coordinates of the geo-point have been entered manually, they can be edited.
Coordinates taken with GNSS or imported from <i>MobileTopographer</i> cannot be changed.<br><p>

The orthometric altitude is computed from the ellipsoidic altitude using the geoid model EGM2008.<br><p>

The <b>Convert</b> button computes the geo-point coordinates in another Coordinate Reference System,
using the app Proj4. The geoid altitude is used in the conversion.
The converted coordinates are displayed and stored in the database with the geo-point.<br><p>

The magnetic declination is computed using the World Magnetic Model for 2020-2025 (this is replaced 
with a more recent WMM when it is released).
The uncertainty of the WMM model declination can be as large as 0.4 degrees in temperate regions.<br>
Check the <b>save</b> box to set the magnetic declination into the survey.<br><p>

The <b>Save</b> button commits the changes to the database.<br><p>
