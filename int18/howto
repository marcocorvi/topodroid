Howto add a translation

[1] get a github account if you don't already have one, and send me your github username so that i can add you to the collaborators of the repo

[2] check out the repo

[3] add the directory int18/values-XX for your translation (replace "XX" with the two-letter country code of the language)

[4] copy res/values/strings.xml res/values/array.xml and res/values/plurals.xml in the translation directory.
    edit the three files and replace the english strings with the translations in your language save them with utf-8 encoding

[4] you can use the PERL script utils/strings_prepare.pl, by R. Severo, to prepare the translation files for your language.


NOTES: 
[A] do not change the order of the strings. 
it is the same for all translations and makes maintenance easier

[B] UNUSED, TODO, FIXME, NO
some strings are commented (i.e., they are in the file but they are not used in the program):
they are marked UNUSED or NO
strings commented and marked with UNUSED or NO must not be translated, or they can be translated but must
remain commented

i will not change a translated string, 
however i do update the translation file to keep them uptodate with the default file (english):
i may add a new string: in this case the new string is added in comment with a a mark TODO.
you should translated it and remove the comment and the mark

i may comment a string because it is not longer used.
in this case i put the string in comment with a mark UNUSED

i may change the english string of a translated string:
i may put the translated string in comment with a mark FIXME
after checking the english and possibly updating the translation remove the comment and the mark

[C] translatable="false"
the array strings with name xxxValue MUST NOT be translated: you can delete them from the translation array.xml file.
The strings marked with translatable="false" MUST NOT be translated: if you want to keep them in the translation file
make sure they are commented.

[D] COPIED strings
it is possible that translated strings are the same as the default (english) strings.
For example the French for "photo" is again "photo".
Nevertheless the string must be translated.

[E] PLURALS
plurals strings may need different "numbers" in your language than in English
use all those that apply.
check lint.out for missing cases in your language

[F] FORMAT STRINGS 
Pay special attention to format strings, ie, strings with the percent marking the format arguments. A mistake in the format can crash the app.
The string_prepare script checks the format strings and if their args do not agree with the default string it replaces with a TODO string

[G] SPECIAL CHARACTERS
some characters must be escaped, in particular the apostroph must be written as "\'" (without double quotes).
other characters must be written as unicode, in particular ellipsis (...) must be written as "&#8230;" (without double quotes).

[H] GUIDELINES
as a guideline strings should be short and concise: there is not much space on the display and the user does not like to read long messages

i am aware that it can be difficult to find a good translation for a string in english without knowing the context where the string is used. if you have doubts you may check the translation in another language (that you know) or write me an email

add your name and email to the welcome message in the translation file strings.xml

push your translation files to github and, if it is a new translation, send me an email since i need to add a s-link to the translation so that it is included in the app

[I] SYMBOLS FILES
add a translation to the symbol files in symbols-git:
you need to add one line with name-XX (where XX is the two-letter iso code of the language)
save the file with utf-8 encoding

NOTE replace spaces in the name with underscore

push the new symbols file to github and let me know
i need to increase the symbols version in the code otherwise topodroid will not install the new files
